## Why use it ?

Managing prompts across a team or a large project can be chaotic. Plain text files lack versioning, are prone to accidental changes, and have no built-in quality control. **Prompt Lockbox** brings the discipline of software engineering to your prompt development workflow.

**Scattered Prompts**
> **Problem:** Your team’s best prompts are lost in a chaotic mess of text files, Slack messages, and Google Docs. No one knows where the “official” version is, leading to confusion and duplicated effort.
>
> ✅ **Solution:** Prompt Lockbox creates a centralized and structured library, making it effortless for your entire team to find and use the correct prompt.

**Untracked Versions**
> **Problem:** You tweak a great prompt and accidentally make it worse, with no way to go back to the version that worked.
>
> ✅ **Solution:** Prompt Lockbox provides Git-like versioning for prompts. Safely create new versions and manage modifications with `plb version`, just like code.

**Accidental Production Changes**
> **Problem:** A critical prompt is changed without approval, breaking your application and causing unpredictable outputs.
>
> ✅ **Solution:** Prompt Lockbox lets you lock and secure key prompts with `plb lock`. The system instantly detects any unauthorized edits with `plb verify`, ensuring production reliability.

**Reinventing the Wheel**
> **Problem:** Your team wastes time building prompts that already exist because they’re impossible to find.
>
> ✅ **Solution:** Prompt Lockbox makes your entire library instantly searchable. Find what you need in seconds with powerful, context-aware search (`fuzzy`, `hybrid`, `splade`).

**Poor Documentation**
> **Problem:** You write a brilliant prompt but have no time to document it, making it unusable for others (or your future self).
>
> ✅ **Solution:** Prompt Lockbox uses AI to automate documentation. One command (`plb prompt document`) generates a clear description and search tags, turning your prompts into reusable assets.

## Key Features

*   **🔒 Integrity & Security:** Lock prompts to generate a checksum. The `plb verify` command ensures that production prompts haven't been tampered with since they were last approved.

*   **📂 Version Control First:** Automatically create new, semantically versioned prompt files with `plb version`, making it easy to iterate and experiment safely without breaking existing implementations.

*   **🤖 AI Superpowers:**
    *   **Auto-Documentation:** `plb prompt document` uses an AI to analyze your prompt and generate a concise description and relevant search tags.
    *   **Auto-Improvement:** `plb prompt improve` provides an expert critique and a suggested, improved version of your prompt template, showing you a diff of the changes.
    *   **Direct Execution:** Execute prompts directly against your configured LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, HuggingFace) right from the CLI.

*   **🔎 Advanced Search:** Don't just `grep`. Build a local search index (`hybrid` TF-IDF + FAISS or `splade`) to find the right prompt instantly using natural language queries.

*   **⚙️ Flexible Configuration:** An interactive wizard (`plb configure-ai`) makes it trivial to set up any provider and model, securely storing API keys in a local `.env` file.

## Installation

The base toolkit can be installed directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install prompt-lockbox
```

To include support for specific AI providers or features, install the optional "extras". You can combine multiple extras in one command.

```bash
# To use OpenAI models
pip install 'prompt-lockbox[openai]'

# To use HuggingFace models (includes torch)
pip install 'prompt-lockbox[huggingface]'

# To use the advanced search features (includes faiss-cpu)
pip install 'prompt-lockbox[search]'

# To install everything
pip install 'prompt-lockbox[all]'
```

## ▶️ Quickstart: Your First 5 Minutes

This guide takes you from an empty directory to executing your first AI-powered prompt.

**1. Initialize Your Project**
Create a directory and run `init`. This sets up the required file structure.

```bash
mkdir my-prompt-project && cd my-prompt-project
plb init
```

**2. Configure Your AI Provider**
Run the interactive wizard to connect to your preferred LLM provider. It will securely save your API keys to a local `.env` file.

```bash
# This launches the interactive setup wizard
plb configure-ai
```

**3. Create Your First Prompt**
The `create` command will guide you through making a new prompt file.

```bash
# This launches an interactive prompt creation wizard
plb create
```
Follow the steps to name your prompt (e.g., "email-formatter"). Now, open the new file at `prompts/email-formatter.v1.0.0.yml` and add your template logic.

**4. Run and Execute**
Test your prompt by rendering it with variables, then execute it with the `--execute` flag to get a live AI response.

```bash
# Render the prompt template with a variable
plb run email-formatter --var user_request="draft a polite follow-up email"

# Send the rendered prompt to your configured AI for a response
plb run email-formatter --var user_request="draft a polite follow-up email" --execute
```
