# PyTSML
## Python Time Series Machine Learning

This package, which was initially made as a result of my MSC Thesis in Computer Engineering, contains Python implementations of few machine learning algorithms designed to work (mainly classify) data in the time series format.

### Currently implemented methods:

- LDMLT (LogDet Divergence-Based Metric Learning With Triplet Constraints) [Mei, J., Liu, M., Karimi, H.R., & Gao, H. (2014). LogDet Divergence-Based Metric Learning With Triplet Constraints and Its Applications. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 23, 4920-4931.];
- DDE (Derivative Delay Embedding) [Zhang, Z., Song, Y., Wang, W., & Qi, H. (2016). Derivative Delay Embedding: Online Modeling of Streaming Time Series. Proceedings of the 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management.];
- KNN classifier with DTW distance.

# Usage
To use the package, build the wheel yourself, install it through pip or just use the source file in Your project.
