# nano-code 🧬📜

`nano-code` is a **tiny, batteries-included code-assistant framework** written in Python 3.11+.  Inspired by Google’s *Gemini Code* demo, it lets you spin up an interactive CLI agent powered by OpenAI (or any compatible) LLM and a growing toolbox of actions such as reading files, listing directories, searching text and more.

The project aims to be **small enough to grok in one sitting** yet **powerful enough to be genuinely useful** when navigating or refactoring real-world codebases.

## ✨ Features

* ⚡ **Single-file CLI** – run `nano-code` and start chatting immediately.
* 🛠 **Agent Tools API** – easily add new tools.  Out-of-the-box you get:
  * `list_dir`, `find_files`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `search_text` …
  * `add_tasks` for quick TODO-list capture.
* 🧠 **Session memory** – every run stores context (working dir, conversation, cost tracking).
* 🔌 **Pluggable LLM** – ships with an OpenAI client but the design allows dropping in other providers.
* 🧪 **Pytest suite** – examples for how to test agents & tools.

## 🚀 Installation

We recommend the blazingly fast [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager, but classic `pip` works too.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo (optional – the package can also live on PyPI later)
git clone https://github.com/gusye1234/nano-code.git
cd nano-code

# 2. Install (requires Python ≥ 3.11)
uv sync

# or for editable dev installs (includes test dependencies)
uv pip install -e '.[dev]'

# fallback (slower) – replace `uv pip` with classic pip if you don't have uv
```

Make sure you have an OpenAI-compatible API key in your environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# Optional – point to an OpenAI-compatible endpoint
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

---

## 🏃‍♀️ Quickstart

```bash
uvx nano-code
```

Behind the scenes the agent converts your plain-English requests into JSON arguments for the tools defined in `nano_code/agent_tool`.  Every tool returns two flavours of output: one optimised for the LLM’s next prompt (`for_llm`) and one for the human terminal (`for_human`).

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests are welcome!  The codebase is intentionally small – feel free to add new tools, improve docs or extend test coverage.  For larger changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

```bash
# run the tests
