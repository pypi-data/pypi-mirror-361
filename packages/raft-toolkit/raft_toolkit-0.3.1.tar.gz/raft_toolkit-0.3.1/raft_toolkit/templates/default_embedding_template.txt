Generate a high-quality vector embedding for the following document content. 
The embedding should capture the semantic meaning, key concepts, and contextual information 
to enable effective similarity search and retrieval in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

Document Type: {document_type}
Content: {content}

Focus on understanding the main themes, technical concepts, factual information, 
and relationships described in the content to create meaningful embeddings.
