    *   [ ] Maven plugin version (if demand exists)

## Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months+)

*   **Web-Based Version:** A web-based version where users can paste their dependency tree and get a visualization without installing the CLI.
*   **IDE Integration:** Plugins for VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse for direct dependency visualization.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Extend beyond Maven to support Gradle, npm, pip, etc.

## Release Strategy

Each release follows this approach:
- **Incremental Value:** Each version adds meaningful value without breaking existing functionality
- **User-Driven:** Priority based on user feedback and common pain points
- **Quality First:** New features include comprehensive tests and documentation
- **Backward Compatibility:** CLI interface remains stable across minor versions
