Overview
--------

The ``PneumaticConveying`` class models pneumatic transport systems for bulk solids using air or gas as the carrier medium. This model incorporates gas-solid flow mechanics, pressure drop calculations, and minimum transport velocity prediction for both dilute and dense phase conveying.
