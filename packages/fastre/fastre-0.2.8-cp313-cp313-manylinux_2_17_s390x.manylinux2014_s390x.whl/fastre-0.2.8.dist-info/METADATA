  🚀 Supercharge your Python regex with Rust-powered performance!

## 🌟 Why fastre ?

fastre is a powerful Python library that wraps the blazing-fast [Rust regex crate](https://crates.io/crates/fancy-regex), bringing enhanced speed to your regular expression operations. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for Python's native `re` module, with some minor syntax differences.

fastre is based on a fork of an earlier implementation called flpc. Whilst flpc offered good performance
it was based on a rust create which didn't support features such as lookarouds. As such there were many
instances where it couldn't be used a drop in replacement for the python re module. It also renamed the match function
fmatch, and didn't implement some methods on the Match and Pattern objects.

fastre takes a different approach and uses the rust based fancy-regex create. Which means that fastre supports features such as back referencing and lookarounds. One of the key features is that if a regex is considered to be simple then the function will be delegated to the rust based regex crate which
performs operations in constant time.

If a fancy feature is used then an alternative approach is employed based on parsing the regex, building
an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then compiling this into a using an implemention of a Virtual
Machine to execute the progam.


## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install fastre:
   ```
   pip install fastre
   ```

2. Use it in your code as shown in the API

## 🔧 API

fastre mirrors the `re` module's API, with a few small exceptions:

- When using `group()` on a match object, always provide an index (e.g., `group(0)` for the entire match)

Common functions include:

- `compile()`
- `search()`
- `findall()`
- `finditer()`
- `split()`
- `sub()`
- `subn()`

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Pre-compile your patterns for faster execution
- Use raw strings (`r''`) for cleaner regex patterns
- Always check if a match is found before accessing groups
- Remember to use `group(0)` to get the entire match
