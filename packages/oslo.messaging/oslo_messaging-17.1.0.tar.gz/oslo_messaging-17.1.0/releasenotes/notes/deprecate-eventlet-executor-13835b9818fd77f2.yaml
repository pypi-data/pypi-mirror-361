deprecations:
  - |
    Eventlet usages are deprecated and the removal of Eventlet from
    OpenStack `is planned <https://governance.openstack.org/tc//goals/proposed/remove-eventlet.html>`_, for this reason the Eventlet executor is
    deprecated. Start migrating your stack to the threading executor.
    Please also start considering removing your internal Eventlet usages.
  - |
    The `executor` parameter of the `MessageHandlingServer` class is now
    deprecated and planned for removal. The Eventlet executor is deprecated.
    Only the threading executor will remains available so the `executor`
    parameter is useless.
