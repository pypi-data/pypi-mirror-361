# Examples

Comprehensive examples showing how to use the SwimRankings library for various tasks.

## Basic Examples

### Simple Search

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Search for athletes by last name
athletes = Athletes(name="Smith")

print(f"Found {len(athletes)} athletes named Smith:")
for athlete in athletes:
    print(f"- {athlete.full_name} ({athlete.birth_year}) from {athlete.country}")
```

### Getting Athlete Details

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Search for an athlete and get detailed information
athletes = Athletes(name="Druwel")
athlete = athletes[0]

# Get detailed information including personal bests
details = athlete.get_details()

print(f"Athlete: {athlete.full_name}")
print(f"Details last updated: {details.last_updated}")
print(f"Personal bests found: {len(details.personal_bests)}")

# Display personal bests
for pb in details.personal_bests:
    print(f"\n{pb.event} ({pb.course})")
    print(f"  Time: {pb.time}")
    if pb.date:
        print(f"  Date: {pb.date}")
    if pb.meet:
        print(f"  Meet: {pb.meet}")
    if pb.location:
        print(f"  Location: {pb.location}")

# Display additional profile information
if details.profile_info:
    print("\nProfile Information:")
    for key, value in details.profile_info.items():
        print(f"  {key.title()}: {value}")
```

### Gender-Specific Search

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Search for male athletes only
male_swimmers = Athletes(name="Johnson", gender="male")
print(f"Male swimmers: {len(male_swimmers)}")

# Search for female athletes only
female_swimmers = Athletes(name="Johnson", gender="female")
print(f"Female swimmers: {len(female_swimmers)}")
```

## Filtering Examples

### Filter by Country

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Get all athletes named "Miller"
athletes = Athletes(name="Miller")

# Filter by specific countries
usa_athletes = athletes.filter_by_country("USA")
can_athletes = athletes.filter_by_country("CAN")
gbr_athletes = athletes.filter_by_country("GBR")

print(f"USA: {len(usa_athletes)}")
print(f"Canada: {len(can_athletes)}")
print(f"Great Britain: {len(gbr_athletes)}")
```

### Filter by Age/Birth Year

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes

athletes = Athletes(name="Wilson")

# Filter by single birth year
born_2008 = athletes.filter_by_birth_year(2008)
print(f"Born in 2008: {len(born_2008)}")

# Filter by age range
young_swimmers = athletes.filter_by_birth_year(2005, 2015)
veteran_swimmers = athletes.filter_by_birth_year(1980, 1999)

print(f"Young swimmers (2005-2015): {len(young_swimmers)}")
print(f"Veteran swimmers (1980-1999): {len(veteran_swimmers)}")
```

### Combined Filtering

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Start with a broad search
athletes = Athletes(name="Brown")

# Apply multiple filters
usa_athletes = athletes.filter_by_country("USA")
young_usa_swimmers = [
    athlete for athlete in usa_athletes 
    if athlete.birth_year >= 2005
]
young_usa_males = [
    athlete for athlete in young_usa_swimmers
    if athlete.gender == "male"
]

print(f"Young USA male swimmers named Brown: {len(young_usa_males)}")
for athlete in young_usa_males:
    print(f"- {athlete.full_name} ({athlete.birth_year})")
```

## Data Analysis Examples

### Country Distribution

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes
from collections import Counter

# Search for a common name
athletes = Athletes(name="Anderson")

# Count athletes by country
countries = [athlete.country for athlete in athletes]
country_counts = Counter(countries)

print("Athletes by country:")
for country, count in country_counts.most_common():
    print(f"{country}: {count}")
```

### Age Distribution

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes
from collections import Counter

athletes = Athletes(name="Taylor")

# Group by decade
birth_decades = []
for athlete in athletes:
    decade = (athlete.birth_year // 10) * 10
    birth_decades.append(f"{decade}s")

decade_counts = Counter(birth_decades)

print("Athletes by birth decade:")
for decade, count in sorted(decade_counts.items()):
    print(f"{decade}: {count}")
```

### Club Analysis

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes
import re

athletes = Athletes(name="Davis")

# Extract club names (remove country prefix)
clubs = []
for athlete in athletes:
    # Remove country prefix like "USA - " or "BEL - "
    club_name = re.sub(r'^[A-Z]{2,3} - ', '', athlete.club)
    clubs.append(club_name)

# Find most common clubs
from collections import Counter
club_counts = Counter(clubs)

print("Most represented clubs:")
for club, count in club_counts.most_common(5):
    print(f"{club}: {count}")
```

## Data Export Examples

### Export to JSON

```python
import json
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Search for athletes
athletes = Athletes(name="Roberts")

# Convert to dictionary format
athletes_data = athletes.to_dict()

# Save to JSON file
with open("athletes.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    json.dump(athletes_data, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)

print(f"Exported {len(athletes_data)} athletes to athletes.json")
```

### Export to CSV

```python
import csv
from swimrankings import Athletes

athletes = Athletes(name="Thompson")
athletes_data = athletes.to_dict()

# Write to CSV
with open("athletes.csv", "w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    if athletes_data:
        fieldnames = athletes_data[0].keys()
        writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        
        writer.writeheader()
        writer.writerows(athletes_data)

print(f"Exported {len(athletes_data)} athletes to athletes.csv")
```

### Export to Pandas DataFrame

```python
import pandas as pd
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Search and convert to DataFrame
athletes = Athletes(name="Williams")
athletes_data = athletes.to_dict()
df = pd.DataFrame(athletes_data)

# Basic analysis
print("Dataset shape:", df.shape)
print("\nCountry distribution:")
print(df['country'].value_counts())

print("\nBirth year statistics:")
print(df['birth_year'].describe())

# Save to Excel
df.to_excel("athletes.xlsx", index=False)
print("Exported to athletes.xlsx")
```

## Advanced Examples

### Batch Processing

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, AthleteNotFoundError
import time

# List of names to search
names = ["Smith", "Johnson", "Williams", "Brown", "Jones"]
all_athletes = []

for name in names:
    try:
        print(f"Searching for {name}...")
        athletes = Athletes(name=name)
        all_athletes.extend(list(athletes))
        print(f"Found {len(athletes)} athletes")
        
        # Be respectful to the server
        time.sleep(1)
        
    except AthleteNotFoundError:
        print(f"No athletes found for {name}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error searching for {name}: {e}")

print(f"\nTotal athletes collected: {len(all_athletes)}")

# Remove duplicates (athletes found in multiple searches)
unique_athletes = list(set(all_athletes))
print(f"Unique athletes: {len(unique_athletes)}")
```

### Statistical Analysis

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes
import statistics

# Collect data from multiple searches
all_athletes = []
for name in ["Miller", "Wilson", "Moore", "Taylor"]:
    try:
        athletes = Athletes(name=name)
        all_athletes.extend(list(athletes))
    except:
        continue

# Analyze birth years
birth_years = [athlete.birth_year for athlete in all_athletes]

print("Birth year statistics:")
print(f"Mean: {statistics.mean(birth_years):.1f}")
print(f"Median: {statistics.median(birth_years)}")
print(f"Mode: {statistics.mode(birth_years)}")
print(f"Range: {min(birth_years)} - {max(birth_years)}")

# Gender distribution
male_count = sum(1 for athlete in all_athletes if athlete.gender == "male")
female_count = sum(1 for athlete in all_athletes if athlete.gender == "female")

print(f"\nGender distribution:")
print(f"Male: {male_count} ({male_count/len(all_athletes)*100:.1f}%)")
print(f"Female: {female_count} ({female_count/len(all_athletes)*100:.1f}%)")
```

### Profile URL Analysis

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes
import webbrowser

# Find young talents (born after 2010)
athletes = Athletes(name="Garcia")
young_talents = athletes.filter_by_birth_year(2010, 2025)

print(f"Found {len(young_talents)} young talents:")
for athlete in young_talents:
    print(f"{athlete.full_name} ({athlete.birth_year}) - {athlete.country}")
    print(f"Profile: {athlete.profile_url}")
    
    # Optionally open profile in browser
    # webbrowser.open(athlete.profile_url)
```

## Error Handling Examples

### Comprehensive Error Handling

```python
from swimrankings import (
    Athletes, 
    AthleteNotFoundError, 
    NetworkError, 
    InvalidGenderError
)

def safe_athlete_search(name, gender="all"):
    """Safely search for athletes with comprehensive error handling."""
    try:
        athletes = Athletes(name=name, gender=gender)
        return list(athletes)
        
    except InvalidGenderError as e:
        print(f"Invalid gender parameter: {e}")
        return []
        
    except AthleteNotFoundError:
        print(f"No athletes found for '{name}' with gender '{gender}'")
        return []
        
    except NetworkError as e:
        print(f"Network error: {e}")
        print("Please check your internet connection and try again.")
        return []
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        return []

# Usage
athletes = safe_athlete_search("TestName", "male")
print(f"Found {len(athletes)} athletes")
```

### Retry Logic

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, NetworkError
import time

def search_with_retry(name, max_retries=3, delay=1):
    """Search with automatic retry on network errors."""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            athletes = Athletes(name=name)
            return list(athletes)
            
        except NetworkError as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            print(f"Network error (attempt {attempt + 1}): {e}")
            print(f"Retrying in {delay} seconds...")
            time.sleep(delay)
            delay *= 2  # Exponential backoff

# Usage
try:
    athletes = search_with_retry("TestName")
    print(f"Found {len(athletes)} athletes")
except NetworkError:
    print("Failed to search after multiple retries")
```
