- [Dense Storage in binary networks](./00_dense_storage.ipynb). A
  whirlwind tour of the Classical Hopfield Network to Dense Associative
  Memory.
- [Energy Transformer](./01_energy_transformer.ipynb). Rederiving the
  Transformer as a pure associative memory
- [Diffusion as Memory](./02_diffusion_as_memory.ipynb). Diffusion
  models try to learn implicitly the energy of data explicitly modeled
  by AMs.
- [Distributed memory](./03_distributed_memory.ipynb). A way to encode
  dense storage capacity in constant parameters.
