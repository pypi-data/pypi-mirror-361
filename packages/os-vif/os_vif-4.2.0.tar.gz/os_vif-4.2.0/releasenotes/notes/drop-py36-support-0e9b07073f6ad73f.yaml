    The yoga release of OpenStack was the final release to support python 3.6
    as a result os-vif has now dropped support for python 3.6. The final release
    of os-vif to support python 3.6 was 2.8.0. os-vif now requires python 3.8
    and is tested with 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. newer versions may work but will
    not be tested in the zed cycle.
