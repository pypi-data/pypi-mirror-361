    Allow creation of transient queues with no expire.
    When an operator rely on rabbitmq policies, there is no point to set the
    queue TTL in config.
    When the rabbit_transient_queues_ttl is set to 0, no x-expire parameter
    will be set on queue declaration.
    In that specific situation, it is recommended to set an expire value using
    rabbitmq policies.
