    Apply a sliding window raster processing operation on an input image and save the result.

    This function processes a raster image in small sliding windows, allowing efficient
    memory management for large datasets by processing chunks. The specified `rasterprocessing`
    operation is applied to each window, with options for padding and overlapping windows.

    Args:
        input_image (str): Path to the input raster image file to be processed.
        output_image (str): Path to save the output raster image after processing.
        rasterprocessing (RasterProcessing): A processing object defining the algorithm and
            parameters to apply on each window of the input image.
        window_size (tuple(int, int), optional): Size of each window for processing,
            default is (1024, 1024).
        window_overlap (int, optional): Number of pixels to overlap between consecutive windows,
            default is 0.
        pad_mode (str, optional, default="edge"): Padding mode for the edges of the windows, default is "edge".
            Refer to `numpy.pad <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html`_ documentation for valid modes.
        bands (List[int], optional): List of specific bands to process. If None, all bands in
            the input image will be processed.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If specified band indices are out of range for the input image.

    Note:
        This function supports concurrent processing and makes use of a thread pool for efficient
        handling of multiple windows. Window padding at the image boundaries is applied as
        specified, and sliding window indices are computed internally.
