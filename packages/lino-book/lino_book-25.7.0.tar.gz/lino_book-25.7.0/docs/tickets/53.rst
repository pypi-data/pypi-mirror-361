#53 : Lino site on a PHP/MySQL-only host?
=========================================

Lino has a disadvantage compared to PHP/MySQL applications: 
renting a virtual host that provides Python and Django is more 
expensive than the PHP and MySQL hosts which you can get for 
much cheaper.

One idea might be possible: 
to have Lino generate .php code which communicates 
directly with a MySQL database.
Only "administrative tasks" like initdb, upgrades and database migrations 
would be run on a machine that has Lino and the application's source 
code installed.

The heart of it would be the communication with the database.
