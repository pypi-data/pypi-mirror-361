# Pandus

A collection of Python functions for various practical examples, including logical gates, learning rules, fuzzy logic, and more.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pandus
```

## Usage

Each function in the `pandus` package prints a string representation of its underlying code. For example:

```python
import pandus

pandus.prac_1()
# This will print the string code defined within the prac_1 function.
```

## Functions

*   `prac_1()`: Implements logical gates (AND, OR, NOT) with McCulloch-Pitts.
*   `prac_2()`: Implements Hebb's learning rule.
*   `prac_3()`: Implements Kohonen SOM.
*   `prac_4()`: Solves the Hamming Network.
*   `prac_5()`: Implements BAM network.
*   `prac_6()`: Finds the winning neuron using MaxNet.
*   `prac_7()`: Implements De-Morganâ€™s Law.
*   `prac_8()`: Implements Union, Intersection, Complement, and Difference operations on fuzzy sets.
*   `prac_9()`: Creates Fuzzy relation by Cartesian product of any two fuzzy sets.
*   `prac_10()`: Performs max-min composition on any two fuzzy relations.
