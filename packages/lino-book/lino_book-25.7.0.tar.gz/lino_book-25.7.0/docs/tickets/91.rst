#91 : Miscellaneous copyright issues
====================================

What about the copyright notice in :srcref:`/bash/oood`?  This is
based on `oooctl <http://svn.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/tools/ooo/oooctl>`_
(copyright "Nuxeo 2007 and contributors" and published using LGPL).  I
made modifications and would like to publish my work independently
with Lino using the GPL.  How to formulate this?
