# Comtegra GPU Cloud CLI Client

## Basic info

CGC Clinet is complete solution to create and manage your compute resources through CLI interface and python code. It incorporates CLI and SDK in one package.

CGC CLI is a command line interface for Comtegra GPU Cloud. CGC CLI enables management of your Comtegra GPU Cloud resources. Current version of the app provides support for compute, storage and network resurces to be created, listed and deleted. Every compute resource is given to you as an URL, which is accessible from open Internet.

To enable better access to your storage resources, every account has the ability to spawn free of charge filebrowser which is local implementation of dropbox. Remember to mount newely created volumes to it.

For now, we provide the ability to spawn compute resources like:

1. [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with tensorflow or pytorch installed as default
2. [Triton inferencing server](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/) for large scale inferencing
3. [Label studio](https://labelstud.io/) for easy management of your data annotation tasks with variety of modes
4. [Rapids](https://rapids.ai/) suite of accelerated libraries for data processing

Notebooks are equiped with all CUDA libraries and GPU drivers which enables the usage of GPU for accelerated computations.
Apart from compute resources, we provide the database engines accessible from within your namespace:

1. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
2. [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/)

More are coming!
Please follow instructions to get started.
