Upgrade instructions
--------------------

- In your local :xfile:`settings.py`, find the line::

    LINO = Lino(__file__)
    
  and change it to::
  
    LINO = Lino(__file__,globals())
    
  The result is that Lino will also adapt the 
  settings FIXTURE_DIRS, MEDIA_ROOT and TEMPLATE_DIRS for you.
  If your :xfile:`settings.py` later sets these variables, 
  should should now uncomment these lines, too. 



For more general instructions on how to upgrade an existing 
Lino site, see :doc:`/admin/upgrade`.

No database migration needed.
