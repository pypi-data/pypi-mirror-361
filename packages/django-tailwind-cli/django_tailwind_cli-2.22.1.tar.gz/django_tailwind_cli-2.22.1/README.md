This library provides an integration of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for Django that is using on the precompiled versions of the [Tailwind CSS CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli).

The goal of this library is to provided the simplest possible Tailwind integration for your Django project. It took its inspiration from the [Tailwind integration for Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/tailwind) which completely skips the neccesity of a node installation.

## Installation

1. Install the library.

   ```shell
   python -m pip install django-tailwind-cli
   ```

2. Add `django_tailwind_cli` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # other Django apps
       "django_tailwind_cli",
   ]
   ```

3. Configure the `STATICFILES_DIRS` parameter in your `settings.py` if not already configured.

   ```python
   STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / "assets"]
   ```

4. Add template code.

   ```htmldjango
   {% load tailwind_cli %}
   ...
   <head>
     ...
     {% tailwind_css %}
     ...
   </head>
   ```

5. Start the debug server.

   ```shell
   python manage.py tailwind runserver
   ```

Enjoy!

## Documentation

The documentation can be found at [https://django-tailwind-cli.rtfd.io/](https://django-tailwind-cli.rtfd.io/)

## Contributing

This package requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and tooling. So you have to [install it](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first. [just](https://github.com/casey/just) is used as a handy command runner to save some typing on the command line. Do yourself a favor and install it too.

```shell
# Setup development environment
just bootstrap

# Upgrade/install all dependencies defined in pyproject.toml
just upgrade

# Run pre-commit rules on all files
just lint

# Run test suite
just test
```

### Without just, but using uv

```bash
# Create venv
uv venv

# Install dependencies
uv sync --all-extras

# Run tox testrunner
uvx --with tox-uv tox
```
