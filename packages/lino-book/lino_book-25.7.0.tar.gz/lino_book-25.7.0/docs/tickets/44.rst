#44 [closed] : Displaying text fields in a grid
===============================================

When a text field is being rendered in a grid, we must 
remember that it can possibly contain a long text which 
would mess up the grid layout if row height is variable. 
That's why we display only the first line by default.
OTOH the user needs a possibilty to "expand" these cells.
