# Quickstart
**Before running:** You will have to have `Java 1.8+` installed on your system (shipped with most linux distributions) and `Python 3.8+`. We recommend creating a conda environment like this:

```bash
conda create --name scienceworld python=3.8
conda activate scienceworld
```

Then, install ScienceWorld either from PyPi:

    pip install scienceworld

or from source in development mode:

    git clone https://github.com/allenai/ScienceWorld.git
    cd ScienceWorld
    pip install .


Run an example random agent, on task 13 (classification: place a non-living thing in a box), for 5 episodes:

    python examples/random_agent.py --task-num=13 --num-episodes=5 --simplifications-preset easy

Run a user console where you can interact with the environment, on task 3 (change of state: melting):

    python examples/human.py --task-num=3 --num-episodes=5


# Web Server Demo

A web server demo is also available, that allows running a ScienceWorld user console that can be interacted with in a web browser.

<h3 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/allenai/ScienceWorld/blob/main/media/web_demo_screenshot.png" width="75%"/></h3>

To run the web server demo:
```bash
conda create --name scienceworld python=3.8
conda activate scienceworld
pip install scienceworld[webserver]
```

Run the web server:

    python examples/scienceworld-web-server-example.py

Point your web browser to:
`localhost:8080`


# ScienceWorld Design
ScienceWorld is written in Scala (2.12.9), and compiles using `sbt` into a JAR file that is run with Java.  For convenience, a Python API is provided (Python >= 3.8), which interfaces using the `py4j` package.

If you modified the Scala code, you can recompile the JAR file by running:
```bash
./simulator/package.sh
pip install -e .
```

# Tasks
The tasks are listed in the table below along with their number of variations. Either the task ID or its name can be used to a task with `env.load()`.

## Simplifications
ScienceWorld supports a number of simplifications that can be applied to the environment to make it easier for agents to learn. These simplifications can be applied by passing the `--simplifications-preset` argument to the command line interface, or by passing the `simplifications` argument to the Python API.

The available simplifications are:
- `teleportAction`: Allows agents to instantly move to any location in the environment.
- `openDoors`: All doors in the environment are open by default.
- `selfWateringFlowerPots`: Automatically waters all flower pots in the environment.
- `noElectricalAction`: Disables electrical actions, making it easier for agents to learn tasks that do not require electrical actions.
- `openContainers`: All containers in the environment are open by default.

The `--simplifications-preset` argument can be set to `easy` to apply the following simplifications:
- `teleportAction`
- `openDoors`
- `selfWateringFlowerPots`
- `noElectricalAction` (for non-connectivity tasks)

> [!WARNING]
> The `easy` preset differs from what is described in the paper (see Appendix B.5). The `openContainers` is not included in that preset and should manually be added if desired.

# Developers

To compile the ScienceWorld JAR file, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
You will need to have `Java 1.8+` SDK installed on your system (shipped with most linux distributions). E.g. on Ubuntu, you can install it with:

    sudo apt-get install openjdk-21-jdk

Then, install sbt (Scala Build Tool) by running:
```bash
    echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
    echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt_old.list
    curl -sL "https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823" | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/sbt.asc
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install sbt
```

### Building the JAR
Once you have `sbt` installed, you can compile the ScienceWorld JAR file by running:
```bash
./simulator/package.sh
```
