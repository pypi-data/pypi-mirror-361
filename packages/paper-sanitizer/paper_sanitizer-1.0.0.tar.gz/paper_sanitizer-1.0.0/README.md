# ðŸ§¼ Paper-Sanitizer

> Strip prompt-injection tricks from academic papers **before** they hit your LLM pipeline.

Researchers keep showing how easy it is to hide  
`Ignore all previous instructions`  
inside a PDF or LaTeX file and fool automated summarizers. Paper-Sanitizer is a tiny command-line tool that removes those hidden instructions, flags stealthy white-on-white text, and rates the overall risk. Use it as a pre-flight check in RAG systems, peer-review helpers, or your own reading workflow.
