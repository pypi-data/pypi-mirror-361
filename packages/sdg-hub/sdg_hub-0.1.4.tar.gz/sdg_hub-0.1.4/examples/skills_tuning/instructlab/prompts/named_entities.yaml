  Please follow these guiding principles when extracting the named entities:

  * Group the entities under appropriate headings in a clean, flat list.
  * Do not include duplicates or generic terms (e.g., "the company").
  * Wrap the output between the tags: [Start of Named Entities] and [End of Named Entities].
