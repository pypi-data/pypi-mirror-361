## Features

-   üìà **Real-Time(ish) Price Data** ‚Äì Because latency is still better than CNBC ads.
-   üßÆ **Custom Watchlists** ‚Äì Sort your tech bros from your energy overlords.
-   üìä **Historical Charts** ‚Äì Plots your portfolio‚Äôs regrets with style.
-   üì∞ **Ticker News** ‚Äì Stay smarter than the talking heads.
-   üé® **Theming** ‚Äì Dark mode? Light mode? You've got taste, and now you‚Äôve got options.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Everything** ‚Äì Refresh rate, default views, and more are all tweakable from the config screen.

**Note:** All ticker symbols must be in the format used by [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple, `^GSPC` for S&P 500, `BTC-USD` for Bitcoin).

## Requirements

-   **Python:** 3.9 or newer.
-   **Operating System:**
    -   **Linux / macOS:** Fully supported.
    -   **Windows:** Requires **Windows Terminal** with PowerShell, or **WSL2**. The application will *not* work correctly in the legacy `cmd.exe` console due to its reliance on advanced terminal features.

## Installation

The recommended way to install stocksTUI is with `pipx`. This installs the application and its dependencies in an isolated environment, ensuring that it does not conflict with any other Python packages on your system.

#### 1. Install `pipx`

If you don't have `pipx` installed, you can install it with your system's package manager or with `pip`.

```bash
# On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install pipx

# On Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S python-pipx

# On macOS
brew install pipx

# Or, using pip (ensure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH)
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

#### 2. Install stocksTUI

Once `pipx` is installed, you can install stocksTUI with a single command:

```bash
pipx install stocksTUI
```

## Usage

To run the application, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
stockstui
```
