#8 : dropTarget and notifyDrop don't get called
===============================================

showcase :srcref:`/extjs-showcases/20101025.html` 
creates a Window with a single Panel that I want 
to act as a drop target for an URL address from 
another browser window.

Maybe Saki's Examples can help:
