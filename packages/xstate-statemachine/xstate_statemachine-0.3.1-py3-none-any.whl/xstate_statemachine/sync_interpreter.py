# ⛓️ Synchronous State Machine Interpreter
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module provides the `SyncInterpreter`, a fully synchronous engine for
# executing state machines. It inherits from `BaseInterpreter` and implements
# a blocking, sequential event processing model.
#
# This interpreter is designed for use cases where asynchronous programming is
# not necessary or desired, such as in command-line tools, desktop GUI
# event loops, or for simpler, predictable testing scenarios.
#
# It adheres to the "Template Method" pattern by overriding the abstract async
# methods from `BaseInterpreter` with concrete synchronous implementations,
# while intentionally raising `NotSupportedError` for features that are
# fundamentally asynchronous (e.g., `after` timers, spawning actors).

# ⛓️ SyncInterpreter Class Definition
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
class SyncInterpreter(BaseInterpreter[TContext, TEvent]):
    """Brings a state machine definition to life by interpreting its behavior synchronously.

    The `SyncInterpreter` manages the machine's state and processes events
    sequentially and immediately within the `send` method call. It is suitable
    for simpler, blocking workflows where asynchronous operations are not needed.

    **Key Characteristics**:
    - **Blocking Execution**: The `send` method blocks until the current event
      and all resulting transitions (including transient "always" transitions)
      are fully processed.
    - **Sequential Processing**: Events are handled one at a time from an
      internal queue, ensuring a predictable order of operations.

    **Design Pattern**:
    This class is a concrete implementation of the "Template Method" pattern
    defined in `BaseInterpreter`. It provides synchronous versions of abstract
    methods related to action execution and service invocation.

    **Limitations**:
    This interpreter does not support features that require a background event
    loop or timer. Any attempt to use a machine with these features will
    result in a `NotSupportedError`. Unsupported features include:
    - ⏰ Timed `after` transitions.
    - 🎭 Spawning child actors (`spawn_` actions).
    - ⏳ Asynchronous `invoke` services that need to run in the background.

    Attributes:
        _event_queue (Deque[Union[Event, AfterEvent, DoneEvent]]): A queue to
            manage the event processing sequence in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.
        _is_processing (bool): A flag to prevent re-entrant event processing,
            ensuring atomicity of a single `send` call's execution loop.
