Sample implementation
=====================

The class `astro_image_display_api.image_viewer_logic.ImageViewerLogic` is provided
as an *example* of how to implement the non-display logic of the Astronomical Image Display API (AIDA).
You do not need to use this class, but it is provided as a convenience to help you
get started with your own implementation. You can feel free to get started by subclassing
it and adding your own display logic on top of it.
