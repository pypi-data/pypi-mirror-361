### For Security Issues in Analyzed APKs

**Important:** Security vulnerabilities found in APKs during analysis are **intended findings** - this is the primary purpose of our tool.

#### ‚úÖ **These are expected results:**
- Vulnerabilities detected in analyzed applications
- Security issues in sample APKs
- Framework-specific security problems

#### üéØ **Responsible actions:**
1. **Report to app developers**, not to us
2. **Follow responsible disclosure practices**
3. **Do not use findings maliciously**
4. **Respect intellectual property**
5. **Comply with applicable laws**

#### ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal and ethical guidelines:**
- Only analyze APKs you own or have explicit permission to test
- Do not distribute or share vulnerable code without permission
- Respect privacy and confidentiality of analyzed applications
- Follow your organization's security policies

## üîí Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security

**Verify Package Integrity:**
```bash
# Install from official PyPI
pip install lu77U-MobileSec

# Verify installation
lu77u-mobilesec --version

# Check for security updates
pip install --upgrade lu77U-MobileSec
```

**Environment Security:**
```bash
# Use virtual environments
python -m venv mobilesec_env
source mobilesec_env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
mobilesec_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install in isolated environment
pip install lu77U-MobileSec
```

### Usage Security

**API Key Management:**
```bash
# Use environment variables (recommended)
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Never commit API keys to version control
echo "*.env" >> .gitignore
echo "api_keys.txt" >> .gitignore

# Use secure key storage
# macOS: Use Keychain
# Windows: Use Windows Credential Manager
# Linux: Use secret-service or similar
```

**Secure Analysis Environment:**
```bash
# Run in isolated environment
docker run --rm -v /path/to/apks:/data ubuntu:20.04

# Use temporary directories
mkdir /tmp/mobilesec_analysis
cd /tmp/mobilesec_analysis

# Clean up after analysis
rm -rf /tmp/mobilesec_analysis
```

**Output Security:**
```bash
# Be careful with output sharing
# Analysis outputs may contain:
# - Decompiled source code
# - API endpoints and secrets
# - Application logic and algorithms
# - Personally identifiable information

# Sanitize outputs before sharing
grep -r "password\|secret\|key\|token" output_dir/
```

### Legal Compliance

**Only analyze APKs you own or have permission to analyze:**
- ‚úÖ Your own applications
- ‚úÖ Applications with explicit written permission
- ‚úÖ Applications under bug bounty programs
- ‚úÖ Open source applications with appropriate licenses

**Do not analyze:**
- ‚ùå Applications without permission
- ‚ùå Copyrighted applications for reverse engineering
- ‚ùå Applications in violation of terms of service
- ‚ùå Applications for malicious purposes

### Network Security

**MobSF Integration:**
```bash
# Use secure connections
export MOBSF_URL="https://your-mobsf-server:8000"

# Validate certificates
export MOBSF_VERIFY_SSL="true"

# Use API authentication
export MOBSF_API_KEY="your-secure-api-key"
```

**AI Provider Security:**
```bash
# For Groq API
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export GROQ_API_BASE="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"

# For local Ollama (more secure)
export OLLAMA_HOST="localhost:11434"
```
