2.  In the configuration file, find the `mcpServers` section and add the following code inside it:

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "growwmcp": {
                "command": "uv",
                "args": [
                "run",
                "--python",
                "3.10",
                 "--reinstall",
                "--with",
                "growwmcp",
                "python",
                "-m",
                "growwmcp",
                "--stdio"
                ],
                "env": {
                    "GROWW_API_KEY": "<your api key here>",
                    "GROWW_API_SECRET": "<your api secret here>"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3.  Replace `<your api key here>` and `<your api secret here>` with the actual keys you got from Groww in Step 2.

4.  Save and close the configuration file.
