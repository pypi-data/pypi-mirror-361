## Reporting a Vulnerability ⚠️

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to responsibly disclose it to us by following the steps below:

1. **Do not create a public issue or discussion about the vulnerability.** 🚫
   - We appreciate your desire to help, but publicly discussing the vulnerability may put users at risk.
  
2. **Report the issue privately.** 📨
   - Please email us at: [<!-- email -->](<!-- email -->) or use our secure issue reporting system on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/hulo-lang/hulo/security).

3. **Include the following information in your report:** 📝
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any mitigation or fixes you’ve identified.
   - The version of the software in which the vulnerability occurs.
   - Any relevant logs or screenshots.

4. **We will confirm receipt and assess the issue.** ✅
   - We will acknowledge receipt of your report and begin our assessment.
   - We may contact you for additional details or clarification as needed.

## Security Updates and Patches 🛠️

We are committed to providing timely fixes for any discovered vulnerabilities. Once a security issue is reported and verified, we will:

- **Investigate the issue** 🔍 and prioritize the fix based on its severity.
- **Publish a patch** 🧰 as soon as possible in a new release.
- **Notify affected users** 📢 via security advisories or updates.

Security patches will be included in the next minor or major release, or as an urgent patch if needed. We encourage all users to regularly check for updates and apply them as soon as they become available.

## Security Best Practices 🛡️

To ensure the security of the project and its users, we follow these best practices:

1. **Regularly audit dependencies** 🔒 to ensure they do not contain known vulnerabilities.
   - We use tools like [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to monitor for outdated or vulnerable dependencies.

2. **Follow secure coding practices** 💻 and review code for potential security risks.
   - Ensure that all sensitive data is properly encrypted.
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information such as API keys or passwords.

3. **Perform vulnerability scanning** 🔎 on the project codebase.
   - We use automated tools and manual code reviews to ensure the codebase is secure.

4. **Ensure proper access control** 🔑 for project contributors and maintainers.
   - All contributors must undergo a review process before being granted write access to the repository.
