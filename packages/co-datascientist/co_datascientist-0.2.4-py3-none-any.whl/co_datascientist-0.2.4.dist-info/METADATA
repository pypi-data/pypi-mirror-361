The future of ML R&D. 

Put in your favourite ML problem and see how far it can be improved.

</div>

## 🚀 Quickstart
1. Install `co-datascientist`:

```bash
pip install co-datascientist
```

2. Prepare your baseline and make sure your code runs in your environement. 
```bash
python myscript.py 
```
Please follow instructions for making sure your baseline is correctly setup. 

After running, it should print out something like:
KPI : 0.5153

3. To use from command line, run:
```bash
co-datascientist run --script-path myscript.py
```

To use from cursor or other AI clients, run the MCP server:
```bash
co-datascientist mcp-server
```

And add the MCP configuration to the AI client. For example in cursor go to:
`file -> preferences -> cursor settings -> MCP -> Add new global MCP server`,
and add the co-datascientist mcp server config in the json, should look like this:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "CoDatascientist": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **IMPORTANT: KPI Tagging for Smart Organization**

> **⚠️ Required for automatic folder organization!**

CoDatascientist automatically organizes your results by performance when you add a simple **KPI tag** to your script:

```python
# At the end of your script, add this line:
print(f"KPI: {your_metric:.4f}")
```

### Examples:
```python
# For accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"KPI: {accuracy:.4f}")  # → folder named "0_9234_your_idea"

# For F1 score
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"KPI: {f1:.4f}")       # → folder named "0_8567_your_idea"

# For custom metrics
custom_score = (accuracy + f1) / 2
print(f"KPI: {custom_score:.4f}")  # → folder named "0_8901_your_idea"
```

### 📁 **What This Does:**
- **Without KPI**: Folders named `baseline/`, `random_forest_idea/`
- **With KPI**: Folders named `0_92_baseline/`, `0_87_random_forest_idea/`
- **Result**: Instantly see which ideas perform best! 🚀

### 📋 **Supported Formats:**
- `KPI: 0.85` ✅
- `kpi: 0.95` ✅ (case insensitive)
- `KPI:0.77` ✅ (no space)
- If no KPI found → uses original naming (safe fallback)


## 💰 Cost Tracking
Track your LLM usage costs automatically:

```bash
# View summary costs
co-datascientist costs

# View detailed breakdown
co-datascientist costs --detailed
```

The system automatically tracks:
- **Total costs** across all workflows
- **Token usage** (input/output tokens)
- **Per-workflow costs** and breakdown
- **Model-specific costs** using LiteLLM's built-in pricing

All costs are calculated in real-time using LiteLLM's `completion_cost()` function with up-to-date pricing for all supported models (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, etc.).
