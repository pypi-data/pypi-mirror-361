# pim-cli

`pim` is a CLI tool to declaratively install and manage machine learning models from a `Pimfile`.

**THIS IS VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT AT THE MOMENT WARNING**

## üöÄ Why Pim?

Modern AI workflows require more than just installing Python packages ‚Äî they depend on large pretrained models, often fetched from different frameworks (like Hugging Face, TorchVision, or Scikit-learn) with inconsistent interfaces and storage behaviors.

**Pim** is a lightweight, framework-agnostic CLI tool that solves this by treating models as first-class dependencies ‚Äî just like packages ‚Äî with simple, reproducible install workflows.

### ‚úÖ What Pim Does
- Installs pretrained models from Hugging Face, TorchVision, and Scikit-learn
- Uses a `Pimfile` (like `Pipfile` or `requirements.txt`) to declare which models your project depends on
- Centralizes model downloads in a shared cache (`~/.pim`) or a user-defined directory
- Supports authentication for gated models (e.g., Hugging Face token access)
- Lets you run `pim install` from anywhere ‚Äî no manual Python scripting required

Pim doesn‚Äôt replace tools like pip or conda ‚Äî it **complements them** by handling the growing complexity of working with large-scale pretrained model artifacts in a clean, declarative, and scriptable way.
