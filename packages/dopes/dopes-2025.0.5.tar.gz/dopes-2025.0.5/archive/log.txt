DesCar version 2.12.2
Entry by: Lahaye Loïc

Additions:
- dash and cross plot style

In progress:
-gfc routine will be used to update all previously created file cleaning routines. Machine object modifier will old settings (skip, colName and colExport) for the gfc routine. Futur DesCar updtate will hence deactivate the legacy dektak/comsol/raman/polytec file cleaning and parsing routines.
-eps plot export was removed in DesCar 2.10.2  => should be added as a global modifier that is being saved between sessions. Should add a "settings" command that show all the global configurations like filePath and soon the eps toggle.
-Plot enhancement => grid should not be by default
-Plot => add the possibility to add an inset

DesCar Version 2.6.1
Entry by: Lahaye Loïc

Additions:
-Global plot modifier. Allows to set plot parameters once and not once per plot execution. Plot routine will automatically detect the presence of a general plot setting. Will use it if there and will ask for it if not
	-plotX: sets the x legend for all plots. 
	-plotY: sets the y legend for all plots.
	-plotTitle: sets the title for all plots.
	-plotStyle: sets the global fancy,line,point,linepoint  for all plots
	-setPlot: DesCar automation to set all parameters.
	-plotClear: clears all global plot parameters
	-re-running any command will overide previous entry. Global settings not saved between sessions
-Dektak cleaning file routine	
	-dektakClean: takes raw .txt dektak measurement and outputs clean xy txt file compatible
-extension modifier:
	-extension: allows to change a given extension to another one of all file in folder

In progress:
-thermal stress estimation based on the differential version of stoney's equation. Almost done. Trouble in the final stress value computation 

Minor bug correction:
-parsePolytec:
	-Goal of the routine
		-Takes raw polytec line or map file, parses them and cleans them. The outputs are separated in 2 folders (line and map) containing clean xy or xyz data
	-Bug description
		-The polytec line file replace saturation of the measurement or abscence of data by a blank line in the measurement. The previous version of the code (2.5.1 and before) replaced those blanks by 0.0. This resulted in error in final plot with ghost points at zero.
	-Bug status
		-Complete fix was implemented and tested on real data. The blank lines are now deleted as they should be.

Major bug correction (update required):
-parsePolytec:
	-Goal of the routine
		-Takes raw polytec line or map file, parses them and cleans them. The outputs are separated in 2 folders (line and map) containing clean xy or xyz data
	-Bug description
		-The routine systematically deleted 120 data point in each file
	-Bug status
		-Complete fix was implemented and tested on real data. The code detecting wheter a line is data/text/blank had to be rewritten. Was done using the module from the dektak cleaning code.
