enhancement:
- title: 'Update reader to import all dataset attributes and drop irrelevant scaling vars'
  description: |
    The reader previously did not pass all of the datasets attributes to downstream plugins.
    This updates the reader so all attributes are passed to downstream readers.
    Scaling attributes are an exception, and are *not* passed because they are 
    irrelevant after scaling is preformed in the reader.
