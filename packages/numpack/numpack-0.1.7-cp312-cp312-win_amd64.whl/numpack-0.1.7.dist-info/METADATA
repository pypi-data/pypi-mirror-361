# NumPack

NumPack is a lightning-fast array manipulation engine that revolutionizes how you handle large-scale NumPy arrays. By combining Rust's raw performance with Python's ease of use, NumPack delivers up to 20x faster operations than traditional methods, while using minimal memory. Whether you're working with gigabyte-sized matrices or performing millions of array operations, NumPack makes it effortless with its zero-copy architecture and intelligent memory management.

Key highlights:
- ðŸš€ Up to 20x faster than traditional NumPy storage methods
- ðŸ’¾ Zero-copy operations for minimal memory footprint
- ðŸ”„ Seamless integration with existing NumPy workflows
- ðŸ›  Battle-tested in production with arrays exceeding 1 billion rows

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for both reading and writing large numerical arrays
- **Lazy Loading Support**: Efficient memory usage through on-demand data loading
- **Selective Loading**: Load only the arrays you need, when you need them
- **In-place Operations**: Support for in-place array modifications without full file rewrite
- **Parallel I/O**: Utilizes parallel processing for improved performance
- **Multiple Data Types**: Supports various numerical data types including:
  - Boolean
  - Unsigned integers (8-bit to 64-bit)
  - Signed integers (8-bit to 64-bit)
  - Floating point (32-bit and 64-bit)

## Usage

### Basic Operations

```python
import numpy as np
from numpack import NumPack

# Create a NumPack instance
npk = NumPack("data_directory")

# Save arrays
arrays = {
    'array1': np.random.rand(1000, 100).astype(np.float32),
    'array2': np.random.rand(500, 200).astype(np.float32)
}
npk.save(arrays)

# Load arrays
# Normal mode
loaded = npk.load("array1")

# lazy load
lazy_array = npk.load("arr1", lazy=True)
```

### Advanced Operations

```python
# Replace specific rows
replacement = np.random.rand(10, 100).astype(np.float32)
npk.replace({'array1': replacement}, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])  # Using list indices
npk.replace({'array1': replacement}, slice(0, 10))  # Using slice notation

# Append new arrays
new_arrays = {
    'array3': np.random.rand(200, 100).astype(np.float32)
}
npk.append(new_arrays)

# Drop arrays or specific rows
npk.drop('array1')  # Drop entire array
npk.drop(['array1', 'array2'])  # Drop multiple arrays
npk.drop('array2', [0, 1, 2])  # Drop specific rows

# Random access operations
data = npk.getitem('array1', [0, 1, 2])  # Access specific rows
data = npk.getitem('array1', slice(0, 10))  # Access using slice
data = npk['array1']  # Dictionary-style access for entire array

# Metadata operations
shapes = npk.get_shape()  # Get shapes of all arrays
shapes = npk.get_shape('array1')  # Get shape of specific array
members = npk.get_member_list()  # Get list of array names
mtime = npk.get_modify_time('array1')  # Get modification time
metadata = npk.get_metadata()  # Get complete metadata

# Stream loading for large arrays
for batch in npk.stream_load('array1', buffer_size=1000):
    # Process 1000 rows at a time
    process_batch(batch)

# Reset/clear storage
npk.reset()  # Clear all arrays

# Iterate over all arrays
for array_name in npk:
    data = npk[array_name]
    print(f"{array_name} shape: {data.shape}")
```

### Lazy Loading and Buffer Operations

NumPack supports lazy loading and buffer operations, which are particularly useful for handling large-scale datasets. Using the `lazy=True` parameter enables data to be loaded only when actually needed, making it ideal for streaming processing or scenarios where only partial data access is required.

```python
from numpack import NumPack
import numpy as np

# Create NumPack instance and save large-scale data
npk = NumPack("test_data/", drop_if_exists=True)
a = np.random.random((1000000, 128))  # Create a large array
npk.save({"arr1": a})

# Lazy loading - keeps data in buffer
lazy_array = npk.load("arr1", lazy=True)  # LazyArray Object

# Perform computations with lazy-loaded data
# Only required data is loaded into memory
similarity_scores = np.inner(a[0], npk.load("arr1", lazy=True))
```

## Performance

NumPack offers significant performance improvements compared to traditional NumPy storage methods, especially in data modification operations and random access. Below are detailed benchmark results:

> - Uses Arc<Mmap> for reference counting, ensuring automatic resource cleanup
> - Implements MMAP_CACHE to avoid redundant data loading
> - Linux-specific optimizations with huge pages and sequential access hints
> - Supports parallel I/O operations for improved data throughput
> - Optimizes memory usage through Buffer Pool to reduce fragmentation
