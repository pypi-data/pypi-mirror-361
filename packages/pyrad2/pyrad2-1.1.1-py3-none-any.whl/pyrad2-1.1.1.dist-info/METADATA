pyrad2 is an implementation of a RADIUS client/server as described in RFC2865 and of RADSEC client/server as described in RFC6614. It takes care of all the details like building RADIUS packets,sending them and decoding responses.

# Introduction

[pyrad2](https://github.com/nicholasamorim/pyrad2) is an implementation of a RADIUS client/server as described in RFC2865. It takes care of all the details like building RADIUS packets, sending them and decoding responses.

What this fork does:
   
- Adds RadSec (RFC 6614) support (Experimental)
- Supports only Python 3.12+
- Extensive typing
- Increased test coverage
- New bug fixes

Note that this is _not_ a stand-alone Radius implementation like [FreeRadius](https://www.freeradius.org). You are supposed to inherit the server classes and code your own behind-the-scenes implementation. This package allows you to code your business logic on top of it.

# Requirements & Installation

pyrad2 requires Python 3.12 and uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). On a Mac, you can simply run `brew install uv`.

# Examples

See the [Getting Started guide](https://nicholasamorim.github.io/pyrad2/getting_started/) for a better overview.

There are a few examples in the `examples` folder. You can either install pyrad2 and use the examples or clone the repo. If you clone the repo, make commands are useful.

The easiest way to start a server is by running `make server`. This will run the example server in `examples/server_async.py`.

If you want to see a request in action, leave the server running, open another terminal and type `make auth`. Several other commands are available such as `make server_radsec`, `make server_coa`, `make_acct`, etc.

# Tests

Run `make test`.
