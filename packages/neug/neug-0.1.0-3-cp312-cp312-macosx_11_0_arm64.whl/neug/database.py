    This class is used to open a database connection and manage the database. User should use this class to
    open a database connection, and then use the `connect` method to get a `Connection` object to interact with the database.

    By passing an empty string as the database path, the database will be opened in memory mode.

    The database could be opened with different modes(read-only or read-write) and different planners.

    When the database is opened in read-only mode, other databases could also open the same database directory in
    read-only mode, inside the same process or in different processes.
    When the database is opened in read-write mode, no other databases could open the same database directory in
    either read-only or read-write mode, inside the same process or in different processes.

    When the database is closed, all the connections to the database will be closed automatically.
