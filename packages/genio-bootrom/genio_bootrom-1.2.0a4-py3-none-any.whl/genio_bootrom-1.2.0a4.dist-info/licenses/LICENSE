    necessary and required for Licensee to exercise its right licensed hereunder
    and such persons are under confidentiality obligations in content at least
    as protective as the provisions hereof, prior to the disclosure of
    Confidential Information. If such person breaches any provisions of the
    Agreement, Licensee agrees to be held jointly and severally liable for any
    damages, costs or expenses incurred by Licensor as a result of such breach.

    misuse, misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential
    Information which may come to the Licensee's attention. 
(b) Licensee may disclose Confidential Information in the following
    circumstances: (i) disclosure to third parties to the extent that the
    Confidential Information is required to be disclosed pursuant to a court
    order or as otherwise required by law, provided that Licensee promptly
    notifies Licensor upon learning of such requirement and has given Licensor a
    reasonable opportunity to contest or limit the scope of such required
    disclosure (including but not limited to making an application for a
    protective order); and (ii) disclosure to a third party under prior written
    consent of Licensor.
(c) The provisions of this Section 6 shall not apply to information which: (i)
    is known to Licensee prior to its receipt of the Confidential Information,

    later becomes part of the public domain without breach of the
    confidentiality obligations in this Agreement; (iii) is received from a
    third party without any breach of any obligation of confidentiality in

    to be used in any products where death, personal injury, or severe physical
    or environmental damage could result from errors or inaccuracies in the
    content, data or information provided by the products or the products
    failing. To the extent permitted by law, Licensee agrees to indemnify,
    defend and hold harmless Licensor, its Affiliates, directors, officers,
    employees, customers, agents and/or subcontractors (each an "Indemnified
    Party") from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and
    costs (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by
    such Indemnified Party as a result of Licensee's use of the Software and
    Documentation in any such products.

    of the terms of this Agreement shall not exceed the aggregate amount of
    license fees paid by Licensee to Licensor for the twelve (12) months
    preceding the event giving rise to the first breach. In no event shall
    either party be liable for special, incidental, consequential, indirect, or
    punitive damages, including loss of profit or revenues, arising out of or in
    connection with this Agreement. The limitations shall apply even if such
    party has been advised of the possibility of such damages and
    notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.
(b) LICENSOR MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSE GRANTED TO
    LICENSEE HEREUNDER, EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AND LICENSOR
    DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED
    WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL
    PROPERTY RIGHT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. LICENSOR SPECIFICALLY
    DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY THAT THE OPERATION OF SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED
    OR ERROR FREE.

    ("RECEIVED ITEM") MAY BE SUBJECT TO EXPORT, IMPORT AND/OR RE-EXPORT
    RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF RELATED JURISDICTIONS.
    LICENSEE SHALL NOT EXPORT, RE-EXPORT, IMPORT OR OTHERWISE SELL, TRANSFER,
    DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, RECEIVED ITEM ACQUIRED HEREUNDER EXCEPT IN STRICT
    COMPLIANCE WITH ALL SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. LICENSEE EXPRESSLY
    AGREES THAT RECEIVED ITEM SHALL NOT BE DOWNLOADED, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE
    EXPORTED OR RE-EXPORTED INTO (OR TO A NATIONAL OR RESIDENT OF) ANY EMBARGOED
    COUNTRIES, NOR TO ANYONE ON RELATED DENIAL LISTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT'S LIST OF SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS OR
    THE U.S. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S TABLE OF DENIAL ORDERS. LICENSEE HEREBY
    REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT IS NOT LOCATED IN, UNDER THE CONTROL OF, OR
    A NATIONAL OR RESIDENT OF, ANY SUCH COUNTRY, OR ON ANY SUCH LIST. WITHOUT
    LIMITING THE FOREGOING, LICENSEE AGREES THAT RECEIVED ITEM PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER SHALL NOT BE EXPORTED, RE-EXPORTED, OR TRANSFERRED TO ANY END-USER
    ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES, OR FOR ANY END-USE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATED TO
    THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, USE, OR STOCKPILING OF WEAPONS OF MASS
    DESTRUCTION (E.G., NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL, OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, AND THE MISSILE
    TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER THEM). LICENSEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
    IT WILL COOPERATE WITH LICENSOR AND/OR RELATED APPLICABLE JURISDICTION TO
    PROVIDE ALL THE NECESSARY ASSISTANCE, INFORMATION AND DOCUMENT TO PROVE ITS
    COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SECTION.
(d) Licensor will not be responsible for the following items with respect to
    software or technology: (i) not supplied by Licensor (including without
    limitation any modifications or additions to the Software or Documentation
    made by Licensee), (ii) made in compliance with Licensee's specifications,
    (iii) made to adhere to published standards, including but not limited to
    GSM, GPRS, EDGE, UMTS(3G), TD-SCDMA, Bluetooth, WAP or successor standards
    whether open or restricted; (iv) combined with other products, processes, or
    materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (v)
    where Licensee continues the activity that is alleged to infringe after
    being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that avoid
    the alleged infringement, or (vi) where use of the Software or Documentation
    is incidental to an infringement not directly resulting from use of such
    Software or Documentation as delivered to Licensee or is not in accordance
    with the rights granted in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
    contained herein to the contrary, Licensee understands and acknowledges that
    the payment payable to Licensor hereunder does not include royalties or fees
    payable based on adherence of Licensed Product or Application to published
    standards, and any such fees are the sole responsibility of Licensee and
    Licensee has the sole responsibility to procure license of any intellectual
    property right for Licensed Product or Application to comply with such
    published standards.
(e) Licensee hereby acknowledges that the Software provided under this Agreement
    might include software from one or more third parties (e.g. open source or
    proprietary, collectively as "Third Party Software") and the use of such
    shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
    the license terms of the Third Party Software as specified in the AIoT
    Software Manifest or third party software license agreement accompanying
    such Third Party Software. Except for the Third Party Software listed in
    AIoT Software Manifest which explicitly stated that such Third Party
    Software will be provided by Licensor, Licensee expressly acknowledges that
    it is Licensee's sole responsibility to obtain from any third party all
    proper licenses contained in the Software. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY WARRANTY SET
    FORTH UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, LICENSOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
    WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAWS,
    WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE.

    party, the non-breaching party shall have the right to terminate this
    Agreement, as applicable, by written notice and all such other remedies as
    are available at law or equity as limited by the terms of this Agreement. 
(d) Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, as applicable, if
    (i) after consultation with Licensee, Licensed Product or Application
    designed and developed by Licensee has a material defect or defects that
    renders it not commercially feasible to continue the development of Licensed
    Product or Application; or (ii) Licensee fails to pay any payment, in whole

    benefit of creditors; (iii) file or have filed against it a petition in
    bankruptcy or seeking reorganization; (iv) have a receiver appointed; or (v)
    institute any proceedings for liquidation or winding up; the other party
    may, in addition to other rights and remedies it may have, terminate this
    Agreement, immediately by written notice.
(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated, Licensee shall immediately
    cease using the Software and Licensor's Confidential Information in any
    manner whatsoever and shall return Software and Licensor's Confidential

    Licensor's Confidential Information according to Licensor's instruction.
    Upon Licensor's request, Licensee shall promptly submit a written
    certificate to certify that all Licensor's Confidential Information has been

    representations or agreements between or among the parties, relating to the
    subject matter hereof.
(b) Licensee shall not assign its rights or delegate its obligation arising
    under this Agreement in whole or in part, without Licensor's prior written
    consent. Any attempted assignment or delegation by Licensee, without such
    consent by Licensor, will be void and constitute a material breach of this
    Agreement which would allow Licensor to terminate this Agreement. Subject to
    the foregoing, all of the rights and obligations of Licensee under this
    Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of Licensee's respective
    successors and permitted assigns.

    laws of Singapore, without regard to any conflict-of-laws rules.
(e) To the extent that any provision, portion or extent of this Agreement is

    such provision materially affects the intent and purpose of this Agreement,
    that provision, portion or extent shall be severed or deleted herefrom, or
    limited in such jurisdiction so as to give effect to the intent of the
    parties insofar as possible and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain
    binding upon the parties. Unless it materially affects the intent and
    purpose of this Agreement, the invalidity or unenforceability of any
    provision in one jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or
    enforceability of (i) such provision in any other jurisdiction or (ii) any
    other provision in any jurisdiction.
(f) The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
    shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
