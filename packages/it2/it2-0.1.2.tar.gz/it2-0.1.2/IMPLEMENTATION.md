# iTerm2 CLI Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the iTerm2 CLI (`it2`), a powerful command-line interface for controlling iTerm2 using its Python API.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Architecture

#### Connection Management (`src/it2/core/connection.py`)
- Singleton pattern for WebSocket connection management
- Automatic connection establishment and cleanup
- Decorators for connection injection (`@with_connection`, `@run_command`)
- Async/await patterns throughout

#### Session Handling (`src/it2/core/session_handler.py`)
- Centralized session operations
- Broadcasting support for multi-session commands
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions

### 2. Command Structure

Implemented command modules:
- **Session Commands**: send, run, list, split, close, clear, restart, etc.
- **Window Commands**: new, list, close, focus, move, resize, fullscreen, arrange
- **Tab Commands**: new, list, close, select, next, prev, goto, move, set-title
- **Profile Commands**: list, show, create, apply, delete, export, import
- **App Commands**: activate, hide, quit, theme, broadcast management
- **Monitor Commands**: output, keystroke, variable, prompt tracking
- **Config Commands**: show path, reload, validate configurations

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

- **Test Coverage**: 65% (98 passed, 9 skipped)
- **Test Categories**:
  - Unit tests for all command modules
  - Integration tests for connection handling
  - Mock-based testing for iTerm2 API interactions
  - Async test support with pytest-asyncio

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Lint Job**: ruff, black, mypy checks
- **Test Job**: Matrix testing on Python 3.10-3.13 (macOS only)
- **Build Job**: Package building and distribution checks
- **Publish Job**: Automated PyPI releases on tag push

#### Key CI Features:
- Integrated release automation (no separate release workflow)
- OIDC authentication for PyPI publishing
- Comprehensive quality checks before release
- Workaround for `license-file` metadata compatibility issue

### 5. Development Tools

#### Makefile Commands:
- `make install`: Install all dependencies
- `make test`: Run tests
- `make lint/format/mypy`: Code quality checks
- `make patch/minor/major`: Version bumping
- `make publish`: PyPI publishing
- `make clean`: Cleanup build artifacts

#### Version Management:
- Automated version bumping script (`scripts/bump_version.py`)
- Updates version in `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`
- Creates git commit and tag automatically
- Integrated with GitHub Actions for release automation

### 6. Configuration System

- YAML-based configuration (`~/.it2rc.yaml`)
- Support for custom profiles and command aliases
- Profile definitions for complex workspace setups
- Alias system for frequently used commands

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Build System
- **Switched from setuptools to hatchling** for modern Python packaging
- Metadata version pinned to 2.2 for compatibility
- PEP 517/518 compliant build configuration

### 2. Dependency Management
- Uses `uv` for fast dependency resolution
- Lock file (`uv.lock`) for reproducible builds
- Minimal production dependencies (iterm2, click, PyYAML, rich)

### 3. Error Handling
- Custom exception hierarchy in `errors.py`
- Graceful degradation for missing iTerm2 features
- User-friendly error messages with actionable feedback

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Mock-heavy approach due to iTerm2 API requirements
- Custom mock factories for iTerm2 objects
- Skip tests requiring unavailable iTerm2 classes
- Focus on command logic rather than API internals

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. License Metadata Compatibility
**Problem**: Hatchling generates `License-File` field that some twine versions don't recognize.
**Solution**: Added grep filter in CI to ignore false-positive warnings while maintaining package validity.

### 2. Async Testing
**Problem**: Testing async iTerm2 API calls with proper mocking.
**Solution**: Custom test utilities that properly handle `iterm2.run_until_complete` patterns.

### 3. Python Version Compatibility
**Problem**: Initial Python 3.7 target incompatible with modern tooling.
**Solution**: Upgraded to Python 3.8+ while maintaining broad compatibility.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Commands**:
   - Workspace save/restore functionality
   - Advanced scripting support
   - Integration with tmux-like session management

2. **Improved Testing**:
   - Integration tests with real iTerm2 instance
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Automated UI testing for visual commands

3. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive API documentation
   - Video tutorials for common workflows
   - Integration guides for popular development tools
