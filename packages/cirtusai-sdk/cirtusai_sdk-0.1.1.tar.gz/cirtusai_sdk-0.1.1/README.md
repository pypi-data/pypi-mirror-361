# CirtusAI Python SDK

The CirtusAI Python SDK provides a simple, robust interface for developers to interact with the CirtusAI backend. It enables seamless agent management, wallet and asset provisioning, decentralized identity (DID) operations, and verifiable credential workflowsâ€”all through a modern, well-documented Python API and CLI.

- **Sync and async support:** Use either synchronous or asynchronous clients.
- **Comprehensive CLI:** Manage agents, wallets, and credentials from the command line.
- **Pydantic models:** Typed request/response validation for reliability.
- **Easy integration:** Designed for third-party developers to get started in minutes.
- **Automated tests and CI:** Ensures reliability and compatibility with the CirtusAI backend.

Whether youâ€™re building identity-driven apps, automating agent provisioning, or issuing verifiable credentials, the CirtusAI SDK makes integration fast and developer-friendly.
