#10 [closed] : Lino doesn't like multiple processes
===================================================

Solved in :doc:`/releases/2010/1027`.

Before this, Lino required Apache to be configured with

::

    WSGIDaemonProcess example.com threads=15

and not with

::

    WSGIDaemonProcess example.com processes=2 threads=15

When Lino was running in multiple processes,
the problem was visible because 
columns of most grids were mixed up. 
The reason for that was that I used Python `sets` when filling the field lists 
(fields, list_fields, detail_fields) of :class:`lino.ui.extjs.ext_store.Store`. 
Each process then resulted in its own column order.
