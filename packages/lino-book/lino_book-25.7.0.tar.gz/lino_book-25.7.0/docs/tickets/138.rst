#138 : Luc's commit messages
============================

This ticket is to collect opinions about my way of writing commit
messages.  My basic idea is that I often want to edit commit messages
afterwards.  I believe that this is useful.  So instead of typing a
few sentences for every commit, I just send a link to the daily blog
entry of that day.

One problem with this system is that the URL of my blog has changed in
the past (and may change again in the future).  

For example when you see a commit messages like this:

  http://docs.lino-framework.org/blog/2014/0729.html

then you cannot simply click on that link fails because the URL of my
blog has changed meanwhile.  So you must convert the URL manually to:

  http://www.lino-framework.org/blog/2014/0729.html
