#38 [closed]: Fields of Slave GridEditor being submitted to master
==================================================================

Grid Editor values being reused when surrounding form submitted

I have a FormPanel on a master record which contains EditorGridPanels 
(each of which contains a list of slave records).

The FormPanel has a submit button which sends the form data 
of the master record.

When a cell in a GridPanel has been edited, the GridPanel's afteredit 
event makes an Ajax request to submit it's value to the slave record.

Now I get problems when slave and master records have fields with the same name.

Ext.form.BasicForm.submit() calls Ext.Ajax.request() 
with the `form` parameter being itself. 
`Ext.Ajax.request()` then calls `Ext.lib.Ajax.serializeForm` to 
automatically extract the field values from the DOM of the given form.

But when a grid cell of a slave has previously been edited, then its Textfield 
has been rendered and its <INPUT> tag is somewhere inside the DOM of the 
master's <FORM>. So serializeForm() will also find the field values for these fields.

The solution was to not give a `name` tag for these fields. 
Because `Ext.lib.Ajax.serializeForm` will then ignore them, while EditorGridPanel 
does not require any name tag on the INPUT element.
