==================================
#141 : Showing vouchers by journal
==================================

A disturbing problem in :ref:`cosi` is that Lino does not yet offer
tables which "open at the end" as TIM did.  For example the
`sales.InvoicesByJournal` table can have many entries, but we usually
want to see only the last ones.

The best solution for this seems to be :doc:`143`.
