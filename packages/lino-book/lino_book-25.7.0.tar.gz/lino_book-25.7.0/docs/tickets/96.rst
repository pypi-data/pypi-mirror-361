#96 : How to read Belgian eID cards in 2014 and thereafter?
===========================================================

Java seems to continue its strategy of creating new problems with
every release...  


So Gerd and I thought that a browser extension should be the right
thing to write for reading Belgian eID cards in 2014 and thereafter.
:ref:`eidreader` seems to be doomed before its birth.  Kalev Lember's
`esteid-browser-plugin
<https://github.com/kalev/esteid-browser-plugin>`_ and the `firebreath
<http://www.firebreath.org/display/documentation/FireBreath+Home>`_
framework seemed so promising.  But now this:

- 2013-12-20 `Browser Plugins in a post-NPAPI world
  <http://www.firebreath.org/display/documentation/Browser+Plugins+in+a+post-NPAPI+world>`_
- 2013-09-23 : Google announce that they drop NPAPI `Saying Goodbye to
  Our Old Friend NPAPI
  <http://blog.chromium.org/2013/09/saying-goodbye-to-our-old-friend-npapi.html>`_

It seems thus clear that firebreath is not the train to take now.

A possible alternative might be to use websockets:
