# MSTT FunASR Plugin

This repository contains the `mstt-funasr` plugin for the Modern Speech-to-Text (MSTT) library. This plugin provides integration with the [FunASR](https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR) models, allowing MSTT to leverage FunASR's capabilities for high-performance speech-to-text transcription.

## Features

- Integrates FunASR models with the MSTT unified API.
- Supports various FunASR models for different languages and tasks.
- Provides efficient and accurate speech transcription.

## Installation

To use this plugin, you need to have MSTT installed first. Then, you can install `mstt-funasr` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install mstt-funasr
```

This will also install the necessary `funasr` library as a dependency.

## Usage

Once installed, the `funasr` model will be automatically available through the MSTT library. You can use it by specifying `model_id="<funasr_model>"` when initializing the MSTT client, `<funasr_model>` can be one of:
- funasr/iic/SenseVoiceSmall
- sensevoice_small
- funasr/iic/speech_paraformer-large-vad-punc_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch
- paraformer-zh
- funasr/iic/speech_paraformer-large-vad-punc_asr_nat-en-16k-common-vocab10020
- paraformer-en
- funasr/iic/speech_conformer_asr-en-16k-vocab4199-pytorch
- conformer-en
- funasr/iic/Whisper-large-v3
- whisper-large-v3
- funasr/iic/Whisper-large-v3-turbo
- whisper-large-v3-turbo


```python
from mstt import get_model

asr_model = get_model("<funasr_model>")
result = asr_model.transcribe("path/to/your/audio.wav")
```

### Example with CLI

You can also use the `funasr` model via the MSTT command-line interface:

```bash
mstt transcribe --model <funasr_model>  path/to/your/audio.wav
```
