#52 : Ext.ensible Calendar Panel
================================

`Extensible <http://ext.ensible.com/>`_ 
(founded by Brian Moeskau, one of the original cofounders of Ext JS)
is a library of Free ExtJS-based calendar components 
including month, week and day views. 

We started end of November 2011 to integrate the `Ext.ensible.cal.CalendarPanel`
into Lino.
