Using
[Meld](https://meldmerge.org)
or
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
to accomplish file differencing.
Useful for managing large numbers of repos / projects, particularly for templates.

```sh
python -m meldutils project/myfile.f90 ~/code
```

graphically compares `project/myfile.f90` with every other file of the same name  recursively under `~/code`.

Particularly on Windows, the GUI may be invoked, but you don't see any difference.
This is often because only one of the two files as a trailing `\n` or `\r\n`.
Meld won't show any difference, even with all text filters off.
Because of how Python `filecmp.cmp` works, there isn't a blazing fast simple solution to this.
A possibly slow solution would be using str.replace.

So just realize it's OK, close Meld when it shows no difference and happy comparing!
