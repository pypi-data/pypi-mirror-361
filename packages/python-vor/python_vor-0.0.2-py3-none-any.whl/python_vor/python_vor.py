def get_bearing(wav_file_path: str, offset: int = 223) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the bearing from a VOR audio file.
    
    This function processes a WAV file containing VOR audio, applies necessary filters,
    and calculates the bearing based on the phase difference between the reference and variable signals.
    It decimates the audio to speed up processing and applies lowpass and bandpass filters to isolate the relevant signals.
    The final bearing is adjusted by the provided offset.
    
    If a correction is needed, the default offset is set to 223 degrees, if the results are not as expected,
    you can adjust the offset using the `offset` parameter. The offset is calculated as follows:
    
    ```python
    new_offset = current_offset + (actual_bearing - calculated_bearing)
    ```
    
    Where `actual_bearing` is the expected bearing based on the recording location and `calculated_bearing`
    is the result from this function. 223 degrees is the calculated offset for my test VOR signals, it might
    not be the same for every VOR or location.
    
    Args:
        wav_file_path (str): Path to the WAV file containing VOR audio.
        offset (int): Offset to be added to the calculated bearing.
    Returns:
        float: Calculated bearing of the recording location to the VOR location in degrees.
