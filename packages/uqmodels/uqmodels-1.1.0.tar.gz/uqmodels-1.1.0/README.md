`UQMODELS` for time series is a python library that seeks to put into practice Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) based on ML/Deep learning models for the analysis of numerical data (Regression and time series). UQModels is inspired by scikit-learn for the creation of ML datascience processing chains incorporating uncertainty quantification mechanisms.

The main objective of these chains is to provide functionality that enhance confidence in model prediction by computing additional UQ-KPI that give insight about ML-modeling uncertainty throught for example : Predictive intervales/Margin of error that catch irreducible variability around an observation, or even local Model unreliability link to the impact of the lack of observation due to data-representativeness issues.

Therefore, the main functionality of the library concerns the modeling step of data science pipeline, through the implementation of an UQModel wrapper that can combine several implementations of forecasting models, UQestimators, and post-processor to form a mathematical processing chain. Then UQModel library provide :
- Several UQEstimators able to estimate several nature of UQ-measure as statistical measure of ML-uncertainty and optionally make prediction.
- UQ-Processing functions that process UQ-measure and/or prediction and/or observation to produce some usefull UQ-KPI.
- Anom-processing functions that process UQ-measures and predictions and observations into a contextual deviation score based on residual (difference between observation and model) prediction normalised by UQmeasure thank to UQ-processing function.
- UQKPI-Processor that wrap UQ-Processing function in a scikit learn Transformer format (fit/tranform procedure) to provide both UQ or Anom KPI
- UQModel wrapper that combine a whole pipeline as a (fit/predict/score) object that produce both prediction and specified UQ-KPI

Such UQ-Model object can be used for example :
 - In the context of monitoring key variables, to characterize the state of a dynamic system
 - For time series monitoring, by providing forecast augmented by uncertainty KPIs (as error margin or model unreliability score) using predict method or anomaly score using score method.

In addition to  modeling-post-processing pipeline, the library also implements minor functionality (in the form of wrappers) designed to facilitate the formalization of the pre-processing and evaluation step. The library aim is illustrated in the following figure.

<div id='quickstart'/>

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
To install and use the uqmodels library, it is recommended to create a Python virtual environment. You can do that with virtualenv, as follows:

### Setting environement
```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p <path/to/python3.9> myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```
### Installation
Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install the uqmodels library directly from Pypi by typing :

```bash
pip install uqmodels
```

This command will install the uqmodels package and all required dependencies.

## Tutorial

Tutorials notebooks are provided here : [examples](https://github.com/IRT-SystemX/uqmodels/tree/main/examples)

<div id='description_main'/>

## ðŸ”€ Description of main object.

UQModel define and manipulate several object in a format close of Scikit learn library.

- UQEstimator are (fit/predict) procedure that follow scikitlearn standards.
  - fit(X,y)
  - predict(X)->pred,UQ
- UQModel are (fit/predict&score) procedure that follow scikitlearn standards.
  - fit(X,y)
  - predict(X) -> pred,list_KPI
  - score(X,y) -> list_KPI

- Processor are (fit/transform) procedure inspired from scikitlearn Transformer but without input/ouput constraint of form.
  - Preprocessor transform data (any form) into processed data (any form)
    - a specific kind of preprocessor that take (any form) and return (X,y) can be set-up witinh and UQModels.
  - Postprocessor transform UQ-modeling output (UQ,type_UQ,pred,y) into KPI (any form)

The chain of a UQModels then breaks down into
 - 1: (optional) A preprocessor that compute features from raw data
 - 2: (optional) A predictor that compute a prediction form features.
 - 3: A UQEstimator, that may compute both prediction, and have to compute UQmeasure.
 - 4: Predict-Post-Processor (optional) that exploit prediction and UQmeasure to compute UQ-KPI
 - 5: Score-Post-Processor (optional) that exploit prediction, UQmeasure and target to compute score-KPI

## ðŸŽ® Usage

The uqmodels library provides several UQEstimators that aim to make UQ-regression, and residu-based anomaly detection. Theses estimators can be used as sklearn or tensorflow model, this mean you need to first import the necessary modules and then initialize and fit the predictor with your own data.

4 notebooks of example are provide on a synthetic mutlivariate time series dataset.

- tutorial_UQModels.ipynb : Shows the basic use of RF-UQ as an UQEstimators to predict target and estimate UQmeasure, then combine it with an UQ-KPIprocessor to estimate confidence interval from the UQmeasre, and then directly encapsulates UQestimator and KPI-Processors for confidence interval, epistemic score and Anomaly-detection into an UQModels object.

- example_UQestimators.ipynb : Shows an loop that execute serverals UQ-Estimators that produce differents kinds of UQmeasure (Variance,Quantile,...) in order to illustrate that UQ-KPI processors can handle several type of UQmeasure.

- example_complex_UQModels.ipynb : Shows that it's possible to run and encapsulate in a UQModel more complex models with 3 probabilistic neural network MLP (mean & variance regression) under 3 UQ-overlay paradigm (MC-Dropout,Deep-ensemble,EDL), and 2 Deep neural newtork (LSTM-ED & Transform-ED) performing mutli-horizon mean & variance regression prediction with MC-Dropout based UQ-overlay.

- illustration_Anom_with_UQ_and_ML_risk_aversion.ipynb : Illustrate on a toy example, how uncertainty decomposition can be used to build an residu based anomaly score considering distinctly uncertainty and ML-risk.

# Fit both UQEstimator and KPI-Processors
RF_UQModel.fit(X[train],y[train])

# Save fitted UQEstimator and KPI-Processors the RF_UQ at path "./model"
RF_UQModel.save('./model')

# New empty UQMOdel 
RF_UQModel = UQModel()

# Load fitted UQEstimator and fitted KPI-Processors
RF_UQModel.load(path='model/'+name)

# Perform prediction and UQ-KPI processing
pred,(UQ,PIs,Elvl) = RF_UQModel.predict(X)

# Perform score processing from features and targets.
KPI_ANOM = RF_UQModel.score(X,y)

# KPI_ANOM is here an multivariate residu based anomaly score considering UQ
