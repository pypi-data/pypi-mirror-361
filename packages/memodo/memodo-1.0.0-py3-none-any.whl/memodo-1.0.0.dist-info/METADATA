# Memodo: An linear attention solution

Memodo is an linear attention solution that combining the advantages of both RWKV and DeltaNet.

# Usage

Just use `memodo.MemodoLayer`, this is an subclass of `torch.nn.Module`.

# Mechanism

Memodo use the General Delta Rule directly:
```
S -> S * diag(i) + S * a^T * b + c^T * d
return r * S
```
With Dynamic Token Shift:
```
d[t] = sigmoid(silu(lerp(x[t], x[t - 1], w1) * w2) * w3)
x[t] = lerp(x[t], x[t - 1], d[t])
```
And gated residual:
```
R -> R + Block(x) * sigmoid(silu(LayerNorm(R) * w1) * w2)
```
