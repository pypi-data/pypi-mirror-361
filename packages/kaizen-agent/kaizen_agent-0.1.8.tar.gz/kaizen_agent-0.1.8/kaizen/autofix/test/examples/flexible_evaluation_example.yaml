  Example test demonstrating flexible output evaluation with multiple targets.
  This test shows how to evaluate return values, specific variables, and
  multiple outputs from a single test execution.

evaluation:
  evaluation_targets:
    - name: summary_text
      source: variable
      criteria: "Should include clarification about the compound's instability"
      description: "The summary text should explain stability concerns"
      weight: 1.0

    - name: recommended_action
      source: variable
      criteria: "Should suggest an experiment or alternative solvent"
      description: "The recommendation should be actionable"
      weight: 1.0

    - name: return
      source: return
      criteria: "Should be a dictionary with 'status' and 'summary' keys"
      description: "The return value should have the expected structure"
      weight: 1.0
