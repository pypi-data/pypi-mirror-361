# Configuration file for the GOAD simulation.
# This file contains the default values for all config options.
# The user should not modify this config, but may make a local copy of it 
#   in this directory called `local.toml`.
# If `local.toml` exists, GOAD will use the values specified in that file.
# Environment variables can be set to override values in this file. 
#   eg. `export GOAD_WAVELENGTH=632.8`
# Configuration options specified on the command line will override values given
#   in this file, as well as those set by environment variables.
