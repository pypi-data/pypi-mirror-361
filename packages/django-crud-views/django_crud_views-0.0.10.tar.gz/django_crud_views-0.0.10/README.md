# Django CRUD Views

Managing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations is a common requirement in Django applications. While Djangoâ€™s
class-based views provide flexibility, implementing CRUD functionality often involves repetitive code.

Django CRUD Views simplifies this process by offering reusable, customizable class-based views that streamline CRUD
operations. This package helps developers write cleaner, more maintainable code while keeping full control over their
views.

This documentation provides everything you need to get started, from installation to advanced customization. Whether
you're building a small project or a large application, Django CRUD Views can help you work more efficiently.

## Features

- a collection of **CrudView**s for the same Django model whereas these views are aware of their sibling views
