# Use Cases

Here are some use cases for the `flujo` library:

1.  **Automated Code Generation:** Generate code snippets or entire functions based on natural language prompts. The library can use different agents for generating, reviewing, and validating the code.
2.  **Text Summarization:** Summarize long documents or articles into concise summaries. The reward model scorer can be used to ensure the quality of the summary.
3.  **Creative Writing:** Generate various forms of creative text like poems, haikus, or limericks. Different agents can be used to control the style and tone of the generated text.
4.  **Batch Processing of Prompts:** Process multiple prompts from a CSV file and save the results. This is useful for tasks like sentiment analysis or data augmentation.
5.  **Custom AI Agent Orchestration:** Build custom AI agent workflows by swapping out different agents for specific tasks. For example, using a cheaper model for initial generation and a more powerful model for review and validation.
6.  **Task Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks that involve natural language understanding and generation. The library's CLI and API make it easy to integrate into existing workflows.
7.  **Benchmarking AI Models:** Benchmark different AI models or prompts by running them multiple times and comparing the results. The library's telemetry features can be used to track performance metrics.
8.  **Educational Tool:** Learn about AI agent orchestration and different scoring mechanisms. The library's clear structure and examples make it a good starting point for beginners.
