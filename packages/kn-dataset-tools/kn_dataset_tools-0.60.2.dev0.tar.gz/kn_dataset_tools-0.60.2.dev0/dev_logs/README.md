# Debug Analysis Directory

This directory contains development analysis, context, and debugging materials.

## Structure

- `parser-priority-analysis.md` - Analysis of parser priority and flow issues
- `context-from-other-sessions/` - Context and notes from other Claude projects/sessions
- `code-snippets/` - Code snippets from various AI conversations (Gemini, etc.)
- `gemini-conversations/` - Specific conversations and analysis from Gemini
- `project-notes/` - General project notes and development insights

## Usage

Drop files here when working with multiple AIs or referencing previous work. This creates a central knowledge base that can be accessed across different development sessions.

## Note on Git Tracking

Currently tracked in git during development phase. May be moved to .gitignore later depending on sensitivity of content and development needs.
