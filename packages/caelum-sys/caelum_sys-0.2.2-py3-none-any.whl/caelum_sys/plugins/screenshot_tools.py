CaelumSys Screenshot Tools Plugin

This plugin provides comprehensive screenshot capabilities including full-screen
captures, delayed screenshots, region-specific captures, and custom file naming.
All screenshot commands use pyautogui for cross-platform compatibility.

Commands provided:
- Basic Screenshots:
  * "take screenshot" - Capture entire screen, save as 'screenshot.png'
  * "take screenshot with delay" - Capture after specified delay (default 3s)
  
- Advanced Captures:
  * "take screenshot with region" - Capture specific screen area by coordinates
  * "take screenshot with custom filename" - Save with user-specified filename
  * "take screenshot with custom format" - Save in different format (jpg, bmp, etc.)

File Management:
- Screenshots are saved to the current working directory
- Default format is PNG for best quality
- Custom filenames should include file extension
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, BMP, TIFF, and others supported by PIL

Dependencies:
- pyautogui: For screen capture functionality
- PIL (via pyautogui): For image processing and format support

Usage Examples:
    >>> from caelum_sys.core_actions import do
    >>> do("take screenshot")
    "ðŸ“¸ Screenshot saved as 'screenshot.png'."
    
    >>> do("take screenshot with delay")  # Uses default 3 second delay
    "ðŸ“¸ Screenshot taken after 3s delay. Saved as 'screenshot_delayed.png'."
    
    >>> do("take screenshot with custom filename my_capture.jpg")
    "ðŸ“¸ Screenshot saved as 'my_capture.jpg'."

All commands in this plugin are marked as safe=True since they only
capture screen content without modifying system state.
