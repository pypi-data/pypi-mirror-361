# pimporter 🐍📦
Clean up your code's cargo.

**pimporter** is a lightweight static analysis tool for inspecting Python import statements.  
It helps you detect:

- Aliases (`as`) used for multiple modules (conflicts)
- Duplicate or hidden import aliases
- Unused imports
- Local vs external imports
- Clean summary per file

---

## 🔧 Installation

Install via pip (after packaging it as a wheel or locally):

```bash
pip install pimporter
````

Or from a local directory:

```bash
pip install .
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
pimporter path/to/your/script_or_directory.py
```

* You can pass either a single Python file or a directory (recursively scans `.py` files).
* The tool will display detailed line-by-line output with color-coded status.

## 🖨️ Example Output

```text
  [!!!] Conflict: Alias 'foo' is used for multiple modules:
    Line 14   -> wurst as foo
    Line 24   -> module_a.foo as foo
    Line 25   -> module_b.foo as foo

    Line   25 - [!!]   unused                   foo from module_b.foo
```

## ✅ Features

* [x] Detects alias conflicts across imports
* [x] Highlights hidden and explicit duplicates
* [x] Differentiates between local and external modules
* [x] Colorized terminal output using `colorama`
* [ ] (Planned) CLI arguments for filtering and exporting
* [ ] (Planned) Export as JSON or markdown

## 📦 Dependencies

* [`colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) – for colorful terminal output

## 💡 Motivation

While linters like `pylint`, `flake8`, or `ruff` cover general import cleanliness, **pimporter** focuses specifically on the **integrity and clarity of alias usage** – particularly useful for larger codebases or shared projects where import patterns can become inconsistent or ambiguous.

## 🧪 Development

Clone and run:

```bash
python -m pimporter path/to/codebase/
```
