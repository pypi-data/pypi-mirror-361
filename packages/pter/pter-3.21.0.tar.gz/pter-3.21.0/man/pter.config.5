.sp
This help describes the configuration files for both pter and qpter.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
.sp
Aside from the data files in the todo.txt format (see Conforming to),
pter\(aqs behaviour can be configured through a configuration file.
.sp
The configuration file\(aqs default location is at \fB~/.config/pter/pter.conf\fP\&.
.sp
There should have been an example configuration file, \fBexample.conf\fP
distributed with your copy of pter that can give you an idea on how that
works. In this documentation you will find the full explanation.
.sp
Note that the configuration file content is case\-sensitive!
.sp
The configuration file is entirely optional and each option has a default
value. That allows you to run pter just fine without ever configuring
anything.
.sp
The configuration file has these four sections:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
General, for general behaviour,
.IP \(bu 2
Symbols, for icons used in the (task) display,
.IP \(bu 2
Keys, to override default keyboard controls in lists,
.IP \(bu 2
Editor:Keys, to override the default keyboard controls in edit fields (detailed in Keys),
.IP \(bu 2
Colors, for coloring the TUI,
.IP \(bu 2
GUI:Colors, for coloring the tasks in the GUI,
.IP \(bu 2
Highlight, for coloring specific tags of tasks,
.IP \(bu 2
GUI:Highlight, for coloring specific tags of tasks (GUI version, see Highlight).
.IP \(bu 2
GUI, for other GUI specific options
.IP \(bu 2
Hooks, for calling external programs at times from within pter

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBuse\-colors\fP
Whether or not to use colors. Defaults to \(aqyes\(aq.
.TP
.B \fBscroll\-margin\fP
How many lines to show at the lower and upper margin of lists. Defaults
to \(aq5\(aq.
.TP
.B \fBsafe\-save\fP
Safe save means that changes are written to a temporary file and that
file is moved over the actual file after writing was completed.
Defaults to \(aqyes\(aq.
.sp
This can be problematic if your files are in folders synchronised with
cloud services.
.TP
.B \fBsearch\-case\-sensitive\fP
Can be set to \fByes\fP (the default), \fBno\fP (make all searches ignore upper/lower case), or
\fBsmart\fP\&. Please consult the section \(dqSmart case\-sensitive search\(dq in the pter/qpter documentation
for details.
.TP
.B \fBauto\-template\-case\-sensitive\fP
Can be set to \fByes\fP (the default), \fBno\fP (auto template matching is case insensitive), or
\fBsmart\fP (if the auto template text has upper case characters, matching this one will be
case sensitive).
.TP
.B \fBhuman\-friendly\-dates\fP
Here you can define what fields of a task, that are known to contain a
date, should be displayed in a more human\-friendly way. By default no
dates are translated.
.sp
Human\-friendly means that instead of a \(aqYYYY\-MM\-DD\(aq format it might
show \(aqnext wednesday\(aq, \(aqtomorrow\(aq, or \(aqin 2 weeks\(aq. It means that
dates, that are further away (in the future or the past) will be less
precise.
.sp
Possible values are \fBdue\fP (for due dates), \fBt\fP (for the
threshold/tickler dates), \fBcompleted\fP (for completion dates),
\fBcreated\fP (for creation dates), or \fBall\fP (for all of the above).
You can also combine these values by comma separating them like this:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
[General]
human\-friendly\-dates = due, t
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBtask\-format\fP
The format string to use for displaying tasks. Defaults to \(dq\fB{selection: >} {nr: >} {done} {tracking }{due }{(pri) }{description}\fP\(dq.
.sp
See Task Format below for more details.
.TP
.B \fBclear\-contexts\fP
A list of comma separated contexts (without the leading \fB@\fP) to remove from a task
when it is being marked as done.
.sp
For example, you might want to remove the \fB@in\fP context or any
\fB@today\fP tags when marking a task as done. In that case
\fBclear\-contexts\fP should be set to \fBin, today\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdefault\-threshold\fP
The default \fBt:\fP search value to use, even when no other search has
been defined. Defaults to \(aqtoday\(aq.
.sp
This option supports Relative Dates (see pter documentation).
.TP
.B \fBdelegation\-marker\fP
Marker to add to a task when delegating it. Defaults to \fB@delegated\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdelegation\-action\fP
Action to take when delegating a task.
One of \(aqnone\(aq, or \(aqmail\-to\(aq (defaulting to \(aqmail\-to\(aq).
.sp
\(aqnone\(aq does nothing, but \(aqmail\-to\(aq will attempt to start your email
program to write an email. If your task has a \(aqto:\(aq attribute (or
whatever you set up for \fBdelegation\-to\fP, it will be used as the
recipient for the email.
.TP
.B \fBdelegation\-to\fP
Attribute name to use when delegating a task via email. Defaults to
\fBto\fP\&. Eg. \(dqclean the dishes to:bob\(dq will compose the email to \(dqbob\(dq
when delegating a task and the delegation action is \(dqmail\-to\(dq.
.TP
.B \fBdue\-delta\fP
The difference that should be used to increase/decrease the due date when
\fBinc\-due\fP or \fBdec\-due\fP is used.
.sp
Defaults to \fB1d\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdue\-skip\-weekend\fP
Whether or not to skip weekends while increasing/decreasing due dates.
.TP
.B \fBbusiness\-days\fP
Define what a business day is for use with \fBb\fP in relative dates.
.sp
This is expected to be a comma\-separated list of ISO weekday numbers
(1 through 7) or weekday names in english (3\-letter version or full name,
capitalisation is ignored).
.sp
Valid examples are: \fBmon, Tue, wed\fP, \fBtuesday, Wednesday\fP, \fB5, 6\fP\&.
.sp
Defaults to \fB1,2,3,4,5\fP (Monday through Friday).
.TP
.B \fBeditor\fP
The external text editor to use instead of whatever is defined in the
\fBVISUAL\fP or \fBEDITOR\fP environment variables.
If pter can’t find a valid editor in neither this configuration option
nor these environment variables, it will fall back to \fBnano\fP in the
wild hopes that it might be installed.
.sp
Defaults to nothing, because the environment variables should be all
that’s required.
.sp
This option is ignored in \fBqpter\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBviewer\fP
The external program to use to view notes. Defaults to \fBless\fP or \fBmore\fP
and has no effect in \fBqpter\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBprotocols\fP
What protocols should be considered when using the \(aqOpen URL\(aq function
on a task. Defaults to \fBhttp, https, mailto, ftp, ftps\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBadd\-creation\-date\fP
Whether or not to automatically add the creation date of a task
to it. Defaults to \fByes\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBcreate\-from\-search\fP
If set to \fByes\fP, positive expressions (that do not refer to time or
\fBdone\fP) of the active search (eg. \fB@context +project word\fP, but not
\fB\-@context due:+7d done:y \-others\fP) will be added automatically to a
newly created task. Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBauto\-id\fP
Whether or not to automatically add an ID to newly created tasks.
Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBhide\-sequential\fP
Whether or not to automatically hide tasks that have uncompleted
preceding tasks (see Task Sequences in pter documentation).
Defaults to \fByes\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBinfo\-timeout\fP
How long should info messages remain visible in the status bar of the
TUI application. Defaults to \fB5\fP, so 5 seconds.
.TP
.B \fBuse\-completion\fP
Whether or not to use completion for contexts (\fB@\fP) and projects
(\fB+\fP) in the search field, task creation, and task editing fields of
the TUI. Defaults to \fByes\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdelete\-is\fP
What behaviour the delete function is actually showing. Can be one of
these:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdisabled\fP, no functionality at all. There is no delete. This is
the default.
.IP \(bu 2

.sp
Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBesc\-timeout\fP
The number of ms curses should wait after \fBEsc\fP has been detected before.
Play around with this if pter is reacting too slowly to you pressing \fBEsc\fP
or doesn\(aqt register when you press key combinations like \fBAlt+Backspace\fP\&.
.sp
Defaults to \fB200\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBreset\-terminal\fP
Reset the terminal extra hard to prevent inconsistent mouse wheel interaction.
.sp
Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBword\-boundaries\fP
Letters that are considered word boundaries when using functions like \fBdel\-word\-left\fP,
\fBdel\-word\-right\fP, \fBgo\-word\-left\fP, and \fBgo\-word\-right\fP\&.
.sp
Defaults to \fB+\- @\fP\&.
.sp
You can enclose the letters with \fB\(dq\fP to ensure spaces are preserved.
.TP
.B \fBtrash\-file\fP
Where your trash file is. This option is only used if \fBdelete\-is\fP is
set to \fBtrash\fP\&. Defaults to \fB~/.config/pter/trash.txt\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBarchive\-is\fP
Defines the behaviour of the \fBarchive\fP function. Can be one of these:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrelative\fP, the archive file is assumed to be in the same place as
the \fBtodo.txt\fP file, but called \fBarchive.txt\fP,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcentralised\fP, there is only one archive file for all \fBtodo.txt\fP

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defaults to \fBcentralised\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBarchive\-file\fP
Where your archive file is. This file will be used to receive archived
tasks if the \fBarchive\-is\fP option is set to \fBcentralised\fP\&. Defaults
to \fB~/.config/pter/archive.txt\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBarchive\-origin\-marker\fP
If you want to add the original filename of the todo.txt file where the
task that you are archiving just now was coming from (especially useful
if you use a \fBcentralised\fP archive file), set this option to the name
of the attribute to add to the archived task.
.sp
For example, if you set this to \fBorigin\fP and archive a task from the
\fBwork.txt\fP, the archived task will have the additional attribute
\fBorigin:work.txt\fP\&.
.sp
By default this option is not set to anything and therefore ignored.
.TP
.B \fBarchive\-origin\-is\fP
What to save as the original task file when archiving a task. Note that
this option is ignored unless \fBarchive\-origin\-marker\fP is set.
.sp
Options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fBname\fP, save only the name of the original file,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstem\fP, save only the filename of the original file, without the suffix (which is most often \fB\&.txt\fP anyway)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default is \fBfull\-path\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdone\-is\fP
Defines the behaviour of the \fBdone\fP function. Can be on of these:

.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmark\fP, just mark the task as done
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmove\fP, move the task into the \fBdone\-file\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmark\-move\fP, mark the task as done and move it into the \fBdone\-file\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that in case of \fBmove\fP or \fBmark\-move\fP toggling the state of a
task from done to not\-done will move the task back from the done file into
\fIone of your open task files\fP (probably the first file).
.sp
Defaults to \fBmark\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdone\-file\fP
Where your file for completed tasks it. This file will be used if \fBdone\-is\fP
is set to \fBmove\fP or \fBmark\-move\fP\&.
.sp
Defaults to \fB~/.config/pter/done.txt\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBreuse\-recurring\fP
Reuse existing recurring task entry instead of creating a new one. If
set, completing a task with a \fBrec:\fP (recurring) tag will be reused
for the follow\-up task instead of creating a new task.
.sp
Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBrelated\-show\-self\fP
Whether or not to show the current task, too, when showing its related
tasks. This can be set to \fByes\fP, \fBno\fP or \fBforce\fP\&.
.sp
\fByes\fP means, not only the related tasks are shown, but also this one.
.sp
\fBforce\fP is the same as \fByes\fP, but if the current task does not have
an \fBid:\fP attribute, it will be given one. In other words, this option
may modify your \fBtodo.txt\fP file.
.sp
Defaults to \fByes\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBsort\-order\fP
The default sorting order if you don\(aqt set one in the search with the
\fBsort:\fP keyword.
.sp
Defaults to \fBcompleted,due_in,priority,linenr\fP
.TP
.B \fBfiles\fP
Default todo file(s) to load. This option is ignored when pter is given
some todo.txt file(s) in the command line parameters.
.sp
For example: \fBfiles = ~/Documents/todo.txt\fP\&.
.sp
To provide multiple files, separate them with newlines, like this:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
[General]
files =
    ~/shared/group_todo.txt
    ~/Documents/todo.txt
    ~/GTD/some day maybe.txt
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The last example shows how to deal with spaces in filenames.
.sp
This option does not apply to qpter, which tracks opened files differently.
.TP
.B \fBnotes\fP
The directories where notes should be looked for when references as \fBnote:\fP
in a task.
.sp
For example: \fBnotes = ~/Documents/task_notes/\fP\&.
.sp
To provide multiple folder, separate them with newlines, like this:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
[General]
notes =
    ~/shared/group_notes/
    ~/Documents/task_notes/
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Multiple folders will be searched in order when opening a task note. If no
note exists, it will be created in the first given folder.
.sp
If this option is not provided, the folders of your selected todo.txt files
will be used. For example, if you use run with \fBDocuments/Tasks/todo.txt\fP and
did not set up this \fBnotes\fP option, the directory \fBDocuments/Tasks/\fP will
be used as the default location for notes.
.TP
.B \fBnote\-suffix\fP
The file extension that\(aqs used when finding notes when the file extension is not
provided.
.sp
Defaults to \fB\&.txt\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBnote\-naming\fP
Defines the behaviour of pter when you edit a task\(aqs note, but no \fBnote:\fP tag
is defined.
.sp
Possible options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcancel\fP, don\(aqt try to edit the task\(aqs note
.IP \(bu 2
\fBauto\fP, create a file based on the task\(aqs ID, create a task ID if necessary
.IP \(bu 2
\fBuser\-input\fP, ask the user for the name of the file
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.sp
Defaults to \fBuser\-input\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBtime\-tracking\fP
What external program you want to use for time tracking. See below, Time Tracking
for all details.
.sp
By default this option is not set, which means that pter\(aqs internal time tracking
is used.
.TP
.B \fBhelp\-actions\fP
A new\-line separated list of actions to show in the help bar of the main task list.
.sp
Defaults to the very basic functions:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
help\-actions =
    show\-help
    quit
    edit\-task
    create\-task
    search

    jump\-to
    next\-item
    prev\-item
    edit\-note
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBinclude\fP
Include these configuration files. May be a newline separated list of additional
configuration files, or a single additional configuration file to load after this
base configuration file has been processed.

For the functions of the second list, the more complex functions for

Now to increase the priority of a task, you would type first \fBp\fP,
followed by \fB+\fP\&.

type the single key shortcut for \fBcancel\fP (usually \fBEscape\fP or \fBCtrl\-C\fP)
or just type any invalid key that\(aqs not part of the sequence (in the

.SH TASK FORMAT
.sp
The task formatting is a mechanism that allows you to configure how tasks are
being displayed in pter. It uses placeholders for elements of a task that you can
order and align using a mini language similar to Python’s format
specification mini\-language <https://docs.python.org/library/string.html#formatspec>
, but
much less complete.
.sp
qpter uses only part of the definition, see below in the list of field
names, if you only care for qpter.
.sp
If you want to show the task’s age and description, this is your
task format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
task\-format = {age} {description}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The space between the two fields is printed! If you don’t want a space
between, this is your format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
task\-format = {age}{description}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You might want to left align the age, to make sure all task descriptions start
below each other:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
task\-format = {age: <}{description}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now the age field will be left aligned and the right side is filled with
spaces. You prefer to fill it with dots?:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
task\-format = {age:.<}{description}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Right align works the same way, just with \fB>\fP\&. There is currently no
centering.
.sp
Suppose you want to surround the age with brackets, then you would want to use
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
task\-format = {[age]:.<}{description}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Even if no age is available, you will always see the \fB[...]\fP (the amount of
periods depends on the age of the oldest visible task; in this example some
task is at least 100 days old).
.sp
If you don’t want to show a field, if it does not exist, for example the
completion date when a task is not completed, then you must not align it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
task\-format = {[age]:.<}{completed}{description}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can still add extra characters left or right to the field. They will not
be shown if the field is missing:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
task\-format = {[age]:.<}{ completed 😃 }{description}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now there will be an emoji next to the completion date, or none if the task has
no completion date.
.sp
All that being said, qpter uses the same \fBtask\-format\fP configuration
option to show tasks, but will disregard some fields (see below) and only
use the field names, but not alignment or decorations.
.SS Field Names

.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBfont\fP
The name of the font to use for the task list.
.TP
.B \fBfont\-size\fP
The font size to use for the task list. You can specify the size either

.SH HOOKS
.sp
Hooks are a mechanism to call external programs under certain conditions from within pter (\fInot\fP qpter).
Hooks are defined in their own \fB[Hooks]\fP section, like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
[Hooks]
on\-select = echo {{full}} > ~/current\-task.txt
on\-quit = rm \-f ~/current\-task.txt
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following hooks exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBon\-start\fP
Is run when pter starts.
.TP
.B \fBon\-select\fP
Is run when the selection of the current task changes.
.TP
.B \fBon\-new\fP
Is run when a task has been created.
.TP
.B \fBon\-tracking\fP
Is run when the user starts tracking a task.
.TP
.B \fBon\-change\fP
Is run when a task has been modified by the user (changed priority, description, marked as completed, etc).
It will not be run if a task is being created, archived, or deleted.
.TP
.B \fBon\-done\fP
Is run when a task is marked as done.
.TP
.B \fBon\-archive\fP
Is run when a task has been archived.
.TP
.B \fBon\-delete\fP
Is run when a task has been deleted.
.TP
.B \fBon\-quit\fP
Is run when pter quits.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Some of these hooks will be run at the same conditions. For example, if \fBon\-start\fP and
\fBon\-select\fP are both defined, both will be run at the start of pter (if there\(aqs a task that can be selected).
In these cases, the order of hook execution is the order that they are listed above. I.e. \fBon\-start\fP will be
run before \fBon\-select\fP, \fBon\-tracking\fP will be run before \fBon\-change\fP\&.
.sp
Even though \fBon\-tracking\fP may appear to have the same functionality as \fBtracking\fP (using an external time
tracker, see below), the difference is that \fBon\-tracking\fP will always be called, even when there is no
external time tracker defined. That also means both, the external time tracker and \fBon\-tracking\fP will be called
if both are defined. \fBon\-tracking\fP will be run after calling the external time tracker.
.SS Parameter format
.sp
You can use several special values to transfer values from the selected task to
the external program:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{{description}}\fP, the bare description without attributes, contexts, or projects
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{{full}}\fP, the full description (without dates or priority)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{{raw}}\fP, the task in its raw todo.txt representation with dates and priority
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{{id}}\fP, the \fBid:\fP attribute (this may be empty if there is no id)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{{project}}\fP, the first project (marked with \fB+\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{{projects}}\fP or \fB{{*projects}}\fP, all projects
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{{context}}\fP, the first context (marked with \fB@\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{{contexts}}\fP or \fB{{*contexts}}\fP, all contexts
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{{note}}\fP, the first \fBnote:\fP attribute (this may be an empty string if there is no such attribute)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also add texts before and after the keywords. For example, if the external program
receives a parameter \fB\-\-label\fP for each context that you would like to add, you could set it up like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
on\-select = external_program {\-\-label {context}}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This would only add the \fB\-\-label\fP if the selected task actually has a context.
.sp
When adding the description, pter will automatically add the quotes, so this will work:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
on\-delete = report_deleted {{project}} {\-\-description {description}} {\-\-label {context}}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In case you wish to add all contexts or projects as parameters to the external program, you
have two options, depending on how multiple values are accepted:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
on\-done = track_completed_tasks {\-\-project {projects}}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
on\-done = track_completed_tasks {\-\-project {*projects}}
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first option will repeat the \fB\-\-project\fP parameter together with each
project tag (like \fB\-\-project p1 \-\-project p2\fP).
The second option will set the \fB\-\-project\fP prefix only once and then add all
project tags (e.g. \fB\-\-project p1 p2\fP).
.SH TIME TRACKING
.sp
The \fBtime\-tracking\fP option can be used to use an external program for time
tracking instead of pter.
.sp
If you set this option, pter will call the configured external program when you
start tracking a task (which is by default on the key \fBt\fP).
.sp
In these examples the documentation will refer to a hypothetical time tracking
program, \fBthe_accountant\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBtime\-tracking\fP option is expected to have the name of the program to
call first, followed by its parameters. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
time\-tracking = the_accountant \-\-start my\-project
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Parameter expansion works exactly the same way as with hooks (see above).
.SS Integration tricks

Note that pter can only communicate that you \fIstart\fP working on a task. If your
time tracking program allows tracking of multiple activities at the same time or
you have to tell it to stop tracking a task before starting with another,
you might have to write a small script that stops tracking and then starts
tracking the task that you selected in pter.
.sp
For example, if \fBthe_accountant\fP required such extras, a simple shell script
to first stop tracking and then start could look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
#!/bin/sh

the_accountant stop
exec the_accountant start \(dq@$\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Instead of using \fBthe_accountant\fP directly for \fBtime\-tracking\fP, you would then use
this shell script.
.SH INCLUDE
.sp
You can specify additional configuration files by specifying the \fBinclude\fP
option in the \fB[General]\fP section, see above.
.sp
The previous method to include a secondary configuration file by means of
the \fB[Include]\fP section is deprecated.
.SH CONFORMING TO
.sp
pter config files are read using Python\(aqs \fBConfigParser\fP and therefore follow its syntax. For more details, see
 <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html> \&.
