## Overview

SDG Hub is designed to simplify data creation for LLMs, allowing users to chain computational units and build powerful flows for generating data and processing tasks. Define complex workflows using nothing but YAML configuration files.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Low-Code Flow Creation**: Build sophisticated data generation pipelines using simple YAML configuration files without writing any code.

- **Modular Block System**: Compose workflows from reusable, self-contained blocks that handle LLM calls, data transformations, and filtering.

- **LLM-Agnostic**: Works with any language model through configurable prompt templates and generation parameters.

- **Prompt Engineering Friendly**: Tune LLM behavior by editing declarative YAML prompts.
