#89 : resolve docs interdependences
-----------------------------------

When I make `pp fab clean`, then afterwards I must first 
build the Lino docs, then all other docs, and then rebuild 
Lino docs again. 

Related problems:

- tidy up :mod:`rstgen.sphinxconf`, turning it into a series of
  well structured Sphinx extensions

- When a `py2rst` code snipet causes an exception, then Sphinx should 
  report a meaninful error message including the name of the guilty file.
