description = "Detect functional block of protein. If you have two different proteins that bind to the same target protein. Struct2Block is an easy tool designed for quickly evaluating the following situations:1) An antibody binds to a receptor. To what extent does it sterically hinder the ligand. 2)2 different ligands bind to the same receptor. To what degree does they compete."
