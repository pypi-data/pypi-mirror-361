# The options and parameters defined in this associated yaml file 
# are only recognized by the likelihood as its class variables/attributes.
# They are loaded automatically with their default values or priors 
# by simply mentioning the likelihood in the input of the Cobaya run, 
# and will be overridden by redefinitions from the input. 
# Private class attributes that cannot be changed by input parameters should start with an underscore.

### Default options

# Theory or likelihood class options are inherited from any ancestor class .yaml files or class attributes. 
# So there are some user-defined options that are common to all classes 
# and do not need to be specified in the defaults [ClassName].yaml file, e.g., the computational speed

### Default values or priors of experimental model parameters (nuisance parameters), 
### accounting for instrumental errors, foregrounds, etc.
### Derived parameters are also specified here.

# For example, Planck likelihood parameters (or nuisance parameters). 
# They typically do not appear in the Cobaya input: they are included automatically at run time.
# However, one is still allowed to add them to the input to redefine any of their properties.
