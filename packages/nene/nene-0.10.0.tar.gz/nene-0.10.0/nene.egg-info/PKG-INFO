Static website generators seem to be the favourite pastime of developers
procrastinating on other more important projects.
So of course, I had to make my own!

When I say *no-frills*, I mean it. Nēnē has no built-in templates, no special
provisions for blogging, plugins, or the sort of thing that would be useful if
you just want to start a website.
But it also tries to combine several nice features from other generators into
something that will appeal to those who want to build their own templates.

> **Trivia:** *Nēnē* continues the long tradition of naming static site
> generators built in Python after birds (the nēnē is a
> [goose endemic to Hawai'i][nene-goose]).

## Documentation

Install instructions and other information can be found in the preliminary
documentation website (built with Nēnē, of course):
[nene.leouieda.com](https://nene.leouieda.com)

**WARNING**: You probably want to pin Nēnē to a specific version since I will
likely break compatibility between releases.
