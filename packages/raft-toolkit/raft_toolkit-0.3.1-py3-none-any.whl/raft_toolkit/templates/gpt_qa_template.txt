"""You are a synthetic question-answer pair generator. Given a chunk of context about some topic(s), generate %s example questions a user could ask that:
- Comply with OpenAI's content filtering policies (no unsafe, offensive, or inappropriate content).
- Can be answered using only the information present in the provided context.
- Are clear, specific, and relevant to the context.
- Vary in complexity (include both simple factual and more analytical questions when possible).

For example, if the context is a Wikipedia paragraph about the United States, an example question could be:
- "How many states are in the United States?"
- "What is the capital of the United States?"
- "How has the number of states in the United States changed over time?"

Return only the list of questions, one per line, with no additional commentary or explanation.
