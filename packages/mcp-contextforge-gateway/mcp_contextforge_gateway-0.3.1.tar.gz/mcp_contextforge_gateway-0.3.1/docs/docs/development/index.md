## üõ† Developer Environment

MCP Gateway is built with:

* **Python 3.10+**
* **FastAPI** + **SQLAlchemy (async)** + **Pydantic Settings**
* **HTMX**, **Alpine.js**, **TailwindCSS** for the Admin UI

Development tools:

* Linters: `ruff`, `mypy`, `black`, `isort`
* Testing: `pytest`, `httpx`
* Serving: `uvicorn`, `gunicorn`

Code style and consistency is enforced via:

```bash
make lint          # runs ruff, mypy, black, isort
make pre-commit    # runs pre-commit hooks on staged files
```

As well as GitHub Actions code scanning.

---

## üß™ Testing

Test coverage includes:

* Unit tests under `tests/unit/`
* Integration tests under `tests/integration/`
* End-to-end tests under `tests/e2e/`
* Example payload performance testing under `tests/hey/`

Use:

```bash
make test          # run all tests
make test-unit     # run only unit tests
make test-e2e      # run end-to-end
```

---

## üîç Linting and Hooks

CI will fail your PR if code does not pass lint checks.

You should manually run:

```bash
make lint
make pre-commit
```

Enable hooks with:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

---

## üê≥ Containers

Build and run with Podman or Docker:

```bash
make podman            # build production image
make podman-run-ssl    # run with self-signed TLS at https://localhost:4444
```

---

## üîê Authentication

Admin UI and API are protected by Basic Auth or JWT.

To generate a JWT token:

```bash
export MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN=$(python3 -m mcpgateway.utils.create_jwt_token --username admin --exp 0 --secret my-test-key)
echo $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN
```

Then test:

```bash
curl -k -sX GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  https://localhost:4444/tools | jq
```

---

## üì¶ Configuration

Edit `.env` or set environment variables. A complete list is documented in the [README](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge#configuration-env-or-env-vars).

Use:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Key configs include:

| Variable            | Purpose                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`      | Database connection          |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY`    | Signing key for JWTs         |
| `DEV_MODE=true`     | Enables hot reload and debug |
| `CACHE_TYPE=memory` | Options: memory, redis, none |
