Adding to the schema
====================

Each stakeholder should have a liaison responsible for writing and maintaining the metadata schema.
If you are unsure who this is, please contact the Greg Ashton or the R&D chairs.

As a liaison, the process to edit the metadata is:

1. Create an issue (or use an existing issue) describing the set of changes and providing an oppotunity for comment.
2. Clone the repository and checkout a branch (:code:`git checkout -b my-branch-name`)
3. Edit the schema file to add or edit sections
4. Commit the changes (to the branch) and push to the repository
5. Navigate to the git.ligo page and click "Create a Merge Request" box that appears at the top
