Command Registry System

This module provides the core registration system for CaelumSys commands.
All plugins use this registry to register their commands, making them
discoverable and executable by the main system.

The registry is a global dictionary that maps command phrases to their
corresponding functions. This allows for dynamic command discovery and
execution without hardcoding command lists.

Example:
    @register_command("mute volume")
    def mute_volume():
        # Command implementation
        return "Volume muted"
        
    # The command is now available via:
    # do("mute volume")
"""

# Global registry to store all registered commands
# Structure: {command_phrase: {"func": function, "safe": boolean}}
registry = {}

def register_command(trigger, safe=True):
    """
    Decorator to register a command with the CaelumSys system.
    
    This decorator allows plugin developers to easily register new commands
    that can be executed via the do() function. Commands are stored in a
    global registry with their trigger phrases and associated metadata.
    
    Args:
        trigger (str): The command phrase that triggers this function.
                      Can include placeholders like "create file at {path}"
        safe (bool): Whether this command is considered safe to execute.
                    Defaults to True. Can be used for command filtering.
    
    Returns:
        function: The decorated function, unchanged but registered.
        
    Example:
        @register_command("get current time")
        def get_time():
            return f"Current time: {datetime.now()}"
            
        @register_command("delete file at {path}", safe=False)
