(obsolete)

- you need a Belgien eID card and a card reader
- eid-applet must be in your classPath or in the :file:`Ã pplets`
  directory as described in :doc:`install`.
- open the file :file:`applets/eid_test.html` in your browser.
  Hint:
  invoking the browser from the command line will make the
  java console visible.

    $ firefox applets/eid_test.html

- There might be a security warning like the following
  (because I didn't yet invest enough time to learn how to avoid it):

- Insert your card and click on "Click here after having inserted your eID card"
