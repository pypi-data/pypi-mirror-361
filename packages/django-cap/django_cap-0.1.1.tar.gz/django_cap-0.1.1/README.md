## Django Cap
This is a implementation of [Cap.js](https://capjs.js.org/) Server for Django, which provides challenge generation and verification for PoW (Proof of Work) captcha. See

## Usage
### Installation
To install the package, simply run:
```bash
pip install django-cap
```

If you want to use the Django Ninja integration, you can install it with:
```bash
pip install django-cap[ninja]
```

Or if you want to use the Django Rest Framework integration, you can install it with:
```bash
pip install django-cap[drf]
```

Note that currently, only ninja integration and vanilla Django Json views are implemented, DRF integration will be added shortly.

### Configuration
To use this package, you need to add `django_cap` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django settings file:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_cap',
    'django_cap.ninja',  # Add this if you want enable ninja integration
]
```

You need to configure the url patterns in your Django project's `urls.py` file:
```python

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path("cap/", include("django_cap.urls")),
    ...
]
```

You can access the api at `/cap/v1/[challenge|redeem|validate]` endpoints. This is compatible with Cap.js/widgets. If your frontend is not hosted by Django, you need to refer Cap.js documentation for the installation, and simply configure the api endpoint as following:
```html
<cap-widget id="cap" data-cap-api-endpoint="https://your-api-site/cap/v1/"></cap-widget>
```

By default, ninja doc will be avaliable at `/cap/v1/docs/` and `/cap/v1/openapi.json`. If you want to disable the ninja doc, you can disable it in your Django settings file:

```python
#django_settings.py
...
CAP_NINJA_API_ENABLE_DOCS = False
...
```

### Use with Django Templates
This package also provides a custom template tag to render the captcha widget in your Django templates. You can use it as follows:
```django html
{% load django_cap %}
<head>
    ...
    <!-- Load the CAP widget script using template tag -->
    {% cap_widget_script %}
    ...
</head>
<body>
    ...
    <!-- Render the CAP widget -->
    {% cap_widget %}
    ...
</body>
```
**TODO**: token validation procedure for Django templates is not implemented yet, currently we only provide the widget rendering. Help welcome if you are familiar with Django templates.
