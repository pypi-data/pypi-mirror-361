## What is Xaibo?

Xaibo is a powerful, protocol-driven framework that enables developers to build sophisticated AI agents with unprecedented flexibility and modularity. By using well-defined interfaces and dependency injection, Xaibo allows you to create, test, and deploy AI systems that are both robust and easily maintainable.

!!! tip "Quick Start"
    **Prerequisites:** Python 3.10 or higher installed
    
    Get up and running with Xaibo in 60 seconds:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uvx xaibo init my_project
    cd my_project
    uv run xaibo dev
    ```
    This will give you an agent that you can start modifiying immediately.

    Follow our [Tutorial](tutorial/index.md) to learn how everything works.

## Why Choose Xaibo?

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>üß© Swap Models & Tools Instantly</h3>
    <p>A modular architecture saves time and reduces complexity. Want to switch from OpenAI to Anthropic? Just change a single line in your configuration.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>üîå Test with Confidence</h3>
    <p>Components communicate through well-defined protocols. This creates clean boundaries, enabling superior unit and integration testing with predictable mocks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-card">
    <h3>üîç Visualize Every Step</h3>
    <p>Transparent proxies capture every component interaction, providing detailed runtime insights and a powerful visual debugger so you always know what your agent is doing.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## See Xaibo in Action: The Visual Debug Interface

Xaibo includes a powerful debug UI that visualizes your agent's operations in real-time:

## A Framework Designed for Developers

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-puzzle-outline: **Protocol-Based Architecture**

    ---

    Components interact through well-defined interfaces, enabling easy testing with mocks and ensuring clean boundaries within your system.

-   :material-swap-horizontal: **Dependency Injection**

    ---

    Explicitly declare component dependencies. This makes it trivial to swap implementations - for testing or for production - without refactoring your code.

-   :material-eye-outline: **Transparent Proxies**

    ---

    Every component is automatically wrapped with observability proxies that capture parameters, timing, and exceptions for complete visibility.

-   :material-chart-timeline-variant: **Comprehensive Event System**

    ---

    A built-in event system provides real-time monitoring, call sequence tracking, and performance insights out of the box. 

-   :material-wrench: **Arbitrary Tool Support**

    ---

    Use tools implemented in simple python, use MCP servers or integrate whatever other APIs you want as tools.

-   :material-api: **Production-Ready API Server**

    ---

    Includes a built-in web server with an OpenAI-compatible API and MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for seamless integration into existing ecosystems.
