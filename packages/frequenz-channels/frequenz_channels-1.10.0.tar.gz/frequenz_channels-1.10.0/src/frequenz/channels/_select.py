"""Select the first among multiple Receivers.

# Usage

If you need to receiver different types of messages from different receivers, you need
to know the source of a particular received message to know the type of the message.

[`select()`][frequenz.channels.select] allows you to do that. It is an
[async iterator][typing.AsyncIterator] that will iterate over the messages of all
receivers as they receive new messages.

It yields a [`Selected`][frequenz.channels.Selected] object that will tell you the
source of the received message. To make sure the received message is *cast* to the
correct type, you need to use the [`selected_from()`][frequenz.channels.selected_from]
function to check the source of the message, and the
[`message`][frequenz.channels.Selected.message] attribute to access the message:

```python show_lines="8:"
from frequenz.channels import Anycast, ReceiverStoppedError, select, selected_from

channel1: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel1")
channel2: Anycast[str] = Anycast(name="channel2")
receiver1 = channel1.new_receiver()
receiver2 = channel2.new_receiver()

async for selected in select(receiver1, receiver2):
    if selected_from(selected, receiver1):
        print(f"Received from receiver1, next number: {selected.message + 1}")
    elif selected_from(selected, receiver2):
        print(f"Received from receiver2, length: {len(selected.message)}")
    else:
        assert False, "Unknown source, this should never happen"
```

Tip:
    To prevent common bugs, like when a new receiver is added to the select loop but
    the handling code is forgotten, [`select()`][frequenz.channels.select] will check
    that all the selected receivers are handled in the if-chain.

    If this happens, it will raise an
    [`UnhandledSelectedError`][frequenz.channels.UnhandledSelectedError] exception.

    If for some reason you want to ignore a received message, just add the receiver to
    the if-chain and do nothing with the message:

    ```python show_lines="8:"
    from frequenz.channels import Anycast, select, selected_from

    channel1: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel1")
    channel2: Anycast[str] = Anycast(name="channel2")
    receiver1 = channel1.new_receiver()
    receiver2 = channel2.new_receiver()

    async for selected in select(receiver1, receiver2):
        if selected_from(selected, receiver1):
            continue
        if selected_from(selected, receiver2):
            print(f"Received from receiver2, length: {len(selected.message)}")
    ```

# Stopping

The `select()` async iterator will stop as soon as all the receivers are stopped. You
can also end the iteration early by breaking out of the loop as normal.

When a single [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] is stopped, it will be reported
via the [`Selected`][frequenz.channels.Selected] object. You can use the
[`was_stopped`][frequenz.channels.Selected.was_stopped] method to check if the
selected [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] was stopped:

```python show_lines="8:"
from frequenz.channels import Anycast, select, selected_from

channel1: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel1")
channel2: Anycast[str] = Anycast(name="channel2")
receiver1 = channel1.new_receiver()
receiver2 = channel2.new_receiver()

async for selected in select(receiver1, receiver2):
    if selected_from(selected, receiver1):
        if selected.was_stopped:
            print("receiver1 was stopped")
            continue
        print(f"Received from receiver1, the next number is: {selected.message + 1}")
    # ...
```

Tip:
    The [`was_stopped`][frequenz.channels.Selected.was_stopped] method is a
    convenience method that is equivalent to checking if the
    [`exception`][frequenz.channels.Selected.exception] attribute is an instance of
    [`ReceiverStoppedError`][frequenz.channels.ReceiverStoppedError].

# Error Handling

Tip:
    For more information about handling errors, please refer to the
    [Error Handling](/user-guide/error-handling/) section of the user guide.

If a receiver raises an exception while receiving a message, the exception will be
raised by the [`message`][frequenz.channels.Selected.message] attribute of the
[`Selected`][frequenz.channels.Selected] object.

You can use a try-except block to handle exceptions as usual:

```python show_lines="8:"
from frequenz.channels import Anycast, ReceiverStoppedError, select, selected_from

channel1: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel1")
channel2: Anycast[str] = Anycast(name="channel2")
receiver1 = channel1.new_receiver()
receiver2 = channel2.new_receiver()

async for selected in select(receiver1, receiver2):
    if selected_from(selected, receiver1):
        try:
            print(f"Received from receiver1, next number: {selected.message + 1}")
        except ReceiverStoppedError:
            print("receiver1 was stopped")
        except ValueError as value_error:
            print(f"receiver1 raised a ValueError: {value_error}")
        # ...
    # ...
```

The [`Selected`][frequenz.channels.Selected] object also has a
[`exception`][frequenz.channels.Selected.exception] attribute that will contain the
exception that was raised by the receiver.

# Typing for select() is tricky.  We had the idea of using a declarative design for
# select, something like:
#
# ```python
# class MySelector(Selector):
#     receiver1: x.new_receiver()
#     receiver2: y.new_receiver()
#
# async for selected in MySelector:
#     if selected.receiver is receiver1:
#         # Do something with selected.message
#     elif selected.receiver is receiver1:
#         # Do something with selected.message
# ```
#
# This is similar to `Enum`, but `Enum` has special support in `mypy` that we can't
# have.
#
# With the current implementation, the typing could be slightly improved by using
# `TypeVarTuple`, but we are not because "transformations" are not supported yet, see:
# https://github.com/python/typing/issues/1216
#
# Also support for `TypeVarTuple` in general is still experimental (and very incomplete
# in `mypy`).
#
# With this we would also probably be able to properly type `select` and *maybe* even be
# able to leverage the exhaustiveness checking of `mypy` to make sure the selected
# message is narrowed down to the correct type to make sure all receivers are handled,
# with the help of `assert_never` as described in:
# https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/typing.html#typing.assert_never
#
# We also explored the possibility of using `match` to perform exhaustiveness checking,
# but we couldn't find a way to make it work with `match`, and `match` is not yet
# checked for exhaustiveness by `mypy` anyway, see:
# https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13597


# We need the noqa here because BaseExceptionGroup can be raised indirectly by
# _stop_pending_tasks.

    """Iterate over the messages of all receivers as they receive new messages.

    This function is used to iterate over the messages of all receivers as they receive
    new messages.  It is used in conjunction with the
    [`Selected`][frequenz.channels.Selected] class and the
    [`selected_from()`][frequenz.channels.selected_from] function to determine
    which function to determine which receiver was selected in a select operation.

    An exhaustiveness check is performed at runtime to make sure all selected receivers
    are handled in the if-chain, so you should call `selected_from()` with all the
    receivers passed to `select()` inside the select loop, even if you plan to ignore
    a message, to signal `select()` that you are purposefully ignoring the message.

    Note:
        The `select()` function is intended to be used in cases where the set of
        receivers is static and known beforehand.  If you need to dynamically add/remove
        receivers from a select loop, there are a few alternatives.  Depending on your
        use case, one or the other could work better for you:

        * Use [`merge()`][frequenz.channels.merge]: this is useful when you have an
          unknown number of receivers of the same type that can be handled as a group.
        * Use tasks to manage each receiver individually: this is better if there are no
          relationships between the receivers.
        * Break the `select()` loop and start a new one with the new set of receivers
          (this should be the last resort, as it has some performance implications
           because the loop needs to be restarted).

    Example:

                # a try-except block. You can also quickly check if the receiver was
                # stopped and let any other unexpected exceptions bubble up.
