# Update goals for clearml-mcp repo (2025-07-12 19:35Z)

_**User**_

I've just scaffolded a new repo called clearml-mcp. I've drafted a plan @GOALS.md  of what we need to do. Can you update the the goals based on your best knowledge and  analysis of the scaffold?

@https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server


---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has scaffolded a new repository called `clearml-mcp` and has a draft plan in `GOALS.md`. They want me to update the goals based on my best knowledge and analysis of the scaffold, and they've provided a link to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server quickstart documentation.

Let me first examine the current project structure and the existing GOALS.md content to understand what they have planned.

Looking at the project layout:
```
clearml-mcp/
  - CHANGELOG.md
  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - Dockerfile
  - docs/
    - license.md
  - GOALS.md
  - LICENSE
  - pyproject.toml
  - README.md
  - src/
    - clearml_mcp/
      - __init__.py
      - clearml_mcp.py
      - py.typed
  - tests/
    - __init__.py
    - test_clearml_mcp.py
```

This shows they have:
1. A Python package structure with `src/clearml_mcp/` (following modern Python packaging conventions)
2. A `pyproject.toml` file instead of `requirements.txt`
3. Already has a `Dockerfile`
4. Has testing structure in place
5. Has proper documentation files

Now looking at the GOALS.md content, I can see it's a comprehensive plan for building a ClearML MCP server. However, there are some discrepancies between the plan and the actual scaffold:

1. The plan mentions a structure with `app/` directory, but the scaffold uses `src/clearml_mcp/`
2. The plan talks about `requirements.txt` but the scaffold uses `pyproject.toml`
3. The plan seems to be focused on FastAPI/web server approach, but modern MCP servers (based on the quickstart) typically use stdio transport


4. The project needs to align with FastMCP library conventions for MCP servers

I'll focus on realigning the project goals to match the current best practices for MCP server implementation, emphasizing stdio transport and command-line configuration while maintaining the core objectives of the original plan.

The key will be to update the project structure, documentation, and implementation approach to create a lightweight, standards-compliant MCP server that can be easily integrated with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible tools.</details></think>

---

I'll analyze your project scaffold and update the GOALS.md file to better align with the actual project structure and modern MCP server patterns based on the official documentation.

---

Read file: pyproject.toml

---

Read file: src/clearml_mcp/clearml_mcp.py

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have a good understanding of the project structure. Let me also check the MCP quickstart documentation to understand the modern patterns for MCP servers. I can see:

1. The project uses modern Python packaging with `pyproject.toml`
2. It uses `src/clearml_mcp/` structure (not `app/`)
3. It's set up for development with proper tooling (ruff, pytest, coverage, etc.)
4. The main module is currently just a placeholder

Based on the MCP quickstart documentation link provided, I need to update the GOALS.md to:

1. Align with the actual project structure (`src/clearml_mcp/` instead of `app/`)
2. Use modern MCP server patterns (stdio transport, not web server)
3. Update dependencies to use `pyproject.toml` instead of `requirements.txt`
4. Focus on command-line MCP server rather than web API server
5. Update the integration approach to match how Claude Desktop integrates with MCP servers

Let me update the GOALS.md file with these improvements.</details></think>

- ### **1.2 Core MCP Server Logic (`app/main.py`)**
+ ### **1.2 Core MCP Server Implementation (`src/clearml_mcp/clearml_mcp.py`)**

- This file contains the main application logic, defining the MCP tools and their implementation. The full implementation is available in the `clearml-mcp-server-code` immersive.
+ Implement the main MCP server using the FastMCP library:

- - **FastMCP Initialization:** Initialize the `FastMCP` server with a unique name (e.g., `"clearml-mcp"`). This name will be used by MCP clients to refer to your server.
- - **Pydantic Models:** Define Pydantic `BaseModel` classes for the MCP response structure (`ModelContextResponse`, `AdditionalContext`, etc.). These models automatically generate the OpenAPI schema and provide data validation/serialization.
- - **MCP Tool Definition:**
-     - Use the `@mcp.tool()` decorator to register your `get_model_context` asynchronous function as an MCP tool.
-     - Define the tool's parameters (e.g., `model_id`, `x_mcp_api_key`) using Pydantic `Field` for type hinting, descriptions, and alias mapping for headers.
-     - Implement the core logic to:
-         - **Authenticate:** Validate the `X-MCP-API-Key` provided by the MCP client against a securely loaded environment variable (`MCP_SERVER_API_KEY`). Raise a `ValueError` for unauthorized access.
-         - **Fetch ClearML Data:** Use the `ClearMLClient` instance to make calls to the ClearML API (`models.get_all`, `tasks.get_all`, `storage.get_signed_url`).
-         - **Error Handling:** Catch potential errors from the `ClearMLClient` (e.g., model not found, API errors) and raise appropriate `ValueError` exceptions. `FastMCP` will handle converting these into standard HTTP error responses.
-         - **Transform Data:** Map the retrieved ClearML data into an instance of your `ModelContextResponse` Pydantic model. Ensure all required fields are populated and data types are correctly converted (e.g., `datetime.fromisoformat` for dates).
-
- ### **1.3 Configuration Management (`app/config.py`)**
+ - **FastMCP Initialization:** Initialize the MCP server with stdio transport
+ - **ClearML Integration:** Connect to ClearML API using official SDK
+ - **MCP Tools Definition:** Define tools for:
+   - `get_model_info`: Retrieve model metadata and details
+   - `list_models`: List available models with filtering
+   - `get_experiment_info`: Get experiment/task details
+   - `list_experiments`: List experiments with search capabilities
+   - `get_model_artifacts`: Download or get URLs for model artifacts
+   - `search_projects`: Search and list ClearML projects
+
+ ### **1.3 Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)**
+
+ Update the dependencies section to include:
+
+ ```toml
+ dependencies = [
+     "fastmcp>=0.1.0",
+     "clearml>=1.16.0",
+     "pydantic>=2.0.0",
+     "typing-extensions>=4.0.0"
+ ]
+ ```
+
+ ### **1.4 Configuration Management**

- - This module will be responsible for loading all necessary configuration parameters from environment variables (`os.getenv`).
+ Implement configuration loading from environment variables:
+
  - **Required Variables:**
-     - `CLEARML_API_SERVER`: URL of your ClearML API server (e.g., `https://api.clear.ml`).
-     - `CLEARML_ACCESS_KEY`: Your ClearML API access key.
-     - `CLEARML_SECRET_KEY`: Your ClearML API secret key.
-     - `MCP_SERVER_API_KEY`: A secret API key that MCP clients will use to authenticate with *your* MCP server.
-     - `PORT`: The port on which your MCP server will listen (e.g., `5000`).
- - Provide sensible default values where appropriate (e.g., for `CLEARML_API_SERVER`).
-
- ### **1.4 ClearML Client Abstraction (`app/clearml_client.py`)**
-
- This module encapsulates all direct interactions with the ClearML REST API. The full implementation is available in the `clearml-mcp-server-code` immersive.
-
- - **Initialization:** The `ClearMLClient` constructor will retrieve ClearML API credentials (`CLEARML_ACCESS_KEY`, `CLEARML_SECRET_KEY`) and the `CLEARML_API_SERVER` URL from environment variables.
- - **API Call Helper:** Implement a private helper method (`_call_api`) to handle common aspects of ClearML API requests, including:
-     - Constructing the full API URL.
-     - Setting necessary headers (Content-Type, x-api-key, x-api-secret).
-     - Sending HTTP requests using the `requests` library.
-     - Checking for HTTP status codes and raising `response.raise_for_status()` for errors.
-     - Handling `requests.exceptions.HTTPError` (for 4xx/5xx responses) and `requests.exceptions.RequestException` (for network issues).
- - **Specific ClearML Methods:** Implement public methods for specific ClearML API calls required by your MCP tools, such as `get_model(model_id)`, `get_task(task_id)`, and `get_signed_url(url)`.
-
- ### **Phase 2: Dockerization for Easy Deployment**
-
- This phase ensures your MCP server can be easily packaged and run on any infrastructure supporting Docker.
-
- ### **2.1 `Dockerfile`**
-
- Create a `Dockerfile` to build a portable Docker image of your MCP server.

- - **Working Directory:** Set the working directory inside the container (e.g., `/app`).
- - **Dependencies:** Copy `requirements.txt` and install Python dependencies.
- - **Application Code:** Copy your `app/` directory into the container.
- - **Exposed Port:** Expose the port your FastAPI application will run on (e.g., `5000`).
- - **Startup Command:** Define the command to run your FastAPI application using `uvicorn` (e.g., `CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:mcp.app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "5000"]`).
-
- ### **2.2 `requirements.txt`**
-
- List all Python packages required by your project. The full list is in the `clearml-mcp-server-code` immersive.
-
- - `mcp[cli]`: Installs the Model Context Protocol Python SDK with FastMCP.
- - `fastapi`: The web framework.
- - `uvicorn`: The ASGI server to run FastAPI.
- - `requests`: For synchronous HTTP calls to the ClearML API.
- - `pydantic`: For data validation and serialization.
-
- ### **2.3 `docker-compose.yml` (Optional, for local testing)**
-
- This file simplifies local development and testing by defining your service and its dependencies.
-
- - **Service Definition:** Define a service for your `clearml-mcp-server`.
- - **Build Context:** Specify the current directory (`.`) as the build context.
- - **Port Mapping:** Map a host port to the container's exposed port (e.g., `"5000:5000"`).
- - **Environment Variables:** Pass environment variables from your `.env` file into the container. **For production, consider Docker Secrets or a dedicated secret management solution instead of directly exposing sensitive keys.**
- - **Restart Policy:** Set a restart policy (e.g., `restart: unless-stopped`).
-
- ### **Phase 3: Gemini Tool Integration**
-
- This phase focuses on how to make your MCP server discoverable and usable by Gemini.
-
- ### **3.1 OpenAPI Specification**
-
- - **Automatic Generation:** Since you are using FastAPI with `FastMCP`, the OpenAPI specification (`openapi.json`) will be automatically generated and served by your running MCP server at the `/openapi.json` endpoint. Interactive documentation (Swagger UI) will be available at `/docs`.
- - **Gemini Tool Definition:** When configuring Gemini, you will provide this dynamically generated OpenAPI specification (or a static copy of it) as the tool definition. The `servers` URL in the OpenAPI spec *must* point to the publicly accessible URL of your deployed MCP server.
-
- ### **3.2 Gemini Tool Code Example**
+   - `CLEARML_API_SERVER`: ClearML API server URL (default: https://api.clear.ml)
+   - `CLEARML_ACCESS_KEY`: ClearML API access key

_**User**_

here @https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/references/sdk/task  does this help?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about the ClearML Task SDK documentation and whether it helps with the goals. Looking at the documentation, this is very helpful for understanding the ClearML Task API and how to interact with it programmatically. This will definitely inform how we implement the MCP tools in the clearml-mcp server.

From the documentation, I can see that the Task class provides many useful methods for:
1. Creating and managing tasks/experiments
2. Getting task information, parameters, artifacts
3. Querying tasks
4. Managing models, metrics, and artifacts
5. Task lifecycle management (start, stop, complete, etc.)

This is very relevant to the MCP server goals because it shows exactly what API methods we have available to build our MCP tools around. I should update the goals to be more specific about which Task methods we'll leverage for each MCP tool.

Let me analyze the key methods that would be most useful for our MCP tools:

For model operations:
- `get_models()` - get models associated with tasks
- `get_model_config_dict()`, `get_model_config_text()` - get model configuration
- `get_model_design()` - get model design/architecture

For task/experiment operations:
- `get_task()` - get a specific task
- `get_tasks()` - get multiple tasks
- `query_tasks()` - query tasks with filters
- `get_all()` - get all tasks
- `get_parameters()`, `get_parameters_as_dict()` - get hyperparameters
- `get_reported_scalars()` - get metrics
- `get_artifacts()` - get artifacts
- `get_status()` - get task status

For project operations:
- `get_projects()` - get projects
- `get_project_name()` - get project name
- `get_project_id()` - get project ID

This gives us a much clearer picture of what's available and how to implement each MCP tool.

I'll refine our approach by mapping specific SDK methods to our tool requirements, ensuring we leverage the most relevant ClearML Task API capabilities for precise functionality.</details></think>

---

Yes, absolutely! The [ClearML Task SDK documentation](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/references/sdk/task) is extremely helpful for understanding exactly what capabilities we have available. This gives us a much clearer picture of how to implement our MCP tools effectively.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I should also update the specific MCP tools section to be more specific about which Task methods we'll use for each tool. This will make the implementation much clearer.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me also update the specific tool implementation sections to leverage the Task SDK methods more effectively. I'll update the Model Context Tools and Experiment Tools sections.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now let me update the Experiment Tools section as well to be more specific about the Task SDK methods.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me also update the Project Management Tools section to include specific Task SDK methods.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now let me also add a note about authentication and configuration since the Task SDK documentation shows we need to handle ClearML authentication properly.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I should add a section about example usage patterns that show how these Task SDK methods would be used in practice. This will make the implementation much clearer.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully updated the GOALS.md file to leverage the specific ClearML Task SDK methods. The documentation was extremely helpful in understanding exactly what capabilities we have available.

The key improvements I made are:

1. **Specific SDK Methods**: Instead of generic descriptions, I now specify exactly which Task methods we'll use for each MCP tool (e.g., `Task.get_models()`, `Task.get_reported_scalars()`, etc.)

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Added methods for all the key operations we need - model info, task details, metrics, artifacts, project management, etc.

3. **Authentication**: Added proper SDK initialization patterns using `Task.init()` or `Task.set_credentials()`

4. **Code Examples**: Added a practical example section showing how to use these methods in practice

5. **Enhanced Tool Definitions**: Made the MCP tool definitions much more specific about which SDK methods they'll leverage

This makes the implementation plan much more actionable and concrete. The developer now has a clear roadmap of exactly which ClearML SDK methods to use for each MCP tool, which will significantly speed up development.

The ClearML Task SDK documentation was indeed very helpful - it gave us the complete picture of what's available and how to use it effectively. This will make the MCP server implementation much more robust and feature-complete.</details></think>

Excellent! The [ClearML Task SDK documentation](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/references/sdk/task) was extremely helpful. I've updated the GOALS.md file to leverage the specific Task SDK methods available, making our implementation plan much more concrete and actionable.

## **Key Improvements Made:**

### **1. Specific SDK Method Mapping**
- Instead of generic descriptions, I now specify exactly which Task methods we'll use for each MCP tool
- For example: `get_model_info` will use `Task.get_models()` and `Task.get_model_config_dict()`

### **2. Comprehensive Task Operations**
- **Model Operations**: `Task.get_models()`, `Task.get_model_config_dict()`, `Task.get_model_design()`
- **Task/Experiment Operations**: `Task.get_task()`, `Task.query_tasks()`, `Task.get_parameters_as_dict()`, `Task.get_reported_scalars()`
- **Artifact Management**: `Task.get_artifacts()`, `Task.get_registered_artifacts()`, `Task.upload_artifact()`
- **Project Management**: `Task.get_projects()`, `Task.get_tasks()` with filters

### **3. Authentication & Configuration**
- Added proper SDK initialization using `Task.init()` or `Task.set_credentials()`
- Connection validation to ensure proper ClearML API access

### **4. Practical Code Examples**
- Added a section showing exactly how to use these methods in practice
- Examples of task queries, project searches, and data retrieval patterns

### **5. Enhanced MCP Tool Definitions**
- Each MCP tool now has specific SDK methods mapped to it
- Added additional tools like `get_task_metrics` and `get_task_parameters` based on available SDK capabilities

This makes our implementation plan much more robust and gives us a clear roadmap for building comprehensive MCP tools that leverage the full power of the ClearML Task SDK. The documentation showed us exactly what's available, and now we have a concrete plan for using each method effectively.

_**User**_

what about integrating it with smithery? @https://smithery.ai/docs

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about integrating their ClearML MCP server with Smithery. Looking at the Smithery documentation, Smithery is a unified gateway for AI agents to access MCP servers. It provides:

1. A unified gateway to connect to multiple MCP servers through a single API endpoint
2. A server marketplace with 8,000+ AI-native services
3. Managed authentication with unified API key management
4. A hosting platform to deploy and distribute MCP servers

This would be a great addition to their ClearML MCP server project. Instead of just having a standalone MCP server that works with Claude Desktop, they could also deploy it to Smithery to make it available to a broader ecosystem of AI agents and applications.

_**User**_

hmmm does it have to be so big? This is for a human/ai to implement. Will it get confusing?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about the size and complexity of the GOALS.md file. They're concerned it might be too big and confusing for a human/AI to implement. Looking at the current structure, I can see that it has grown quite comprehensive with 8 phases and many detailed subsections. This might indeed be overwhelming for implementation.

I should simplify and streamline the plan to make it more actionable and less intimidating. I can:

1. Reduce the number of phases
2. Consolidate related items
3. Focus on the core essentials first
4. Move advanced features to later phases
5. Make it more implementation-friendly

Let me create a more streamlined version that's easier to follow and implement.</details></think>

---

You're absolutely right! The plan has grown quite comprehensive and could be overwhelming for implementation. Let me streamline it to focus on the essentials and make it more actionable.

_**User**_

btw this will also be pushed to pypi as clearml-mcp (if its on smithery, do I need pypi?)

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about whether they need PyPI if they're on Smithery. This is a good question about distribution strategy. Let me think about this:

1. PyPI is for Python package distribution - people install with `pip install clearml-mcp`
2. Smithery is an MCP server marketplace - AI agents access servers through Smithery's gateway
3. These serve different purposes:
   - PyPI: For developers who want to self-host or use directly with Claude Desktop
   - Smithery: For AI agents to access the server through the marketplace

So they're complementary, not competing. PyPI enables local installation and Claude Desktop integration, while Smithery enables broader AI agent access.

But the user is also concerned about the plan being too big and confusing. Let me address both concerns by simplifying the plan significantly while clarifying the PyPI vs Smithery question.</details></think>

---

Great question! PyPI and Smithery serve different purposes and are actually complementary:

**PyPI (`pip install clearml-mcp`):**
- For developers who want to self-host or integrate directly with Claude Desktop
- Enables local installation and stdio transport
- Traditional Python package distribution

**Smithery:**
- For AI agents to access your server through their marketplace gateway
- Managed hosting and unified authentication
- Broader AI agent ecosystem access

You'll want **both** because they serve different use cases!

But you're absolutely right about the plan being too big. Let me dramatically simplify it to focus on what actually matters for implementation:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Much better! I've dramatically simplified the plan from a complex 8-phase behemoth to a focused 3-phase implementation plan that's actually actionable. The key changes:

1. **Simplified scope**: From 8 phases to 3 phases
2. **Focused on essentials**: 4-5 core MCP tools instead of comprehensive coverage
3. **Clear priorities**: Core tools → PyPI → Claude Desktop → Smithery
4. **Realistic scope**: ~200-300 lines of code instead of enterprise-level complexity
5. **Actionable**: Each phase has clear deliverables

The user also asked about PyPI vs Smithery, and I clarified that they're complementary:
- PyPI: For developers who want to self-host (`pip install clearml-mcp`)
- Smithery: For AI agents to access through the marketplace

This is much more implementable and less overwhelming!</details></think>

Perfect! I've dramatically simplified the plan from 8 overwhelming phases to 3 focused phases. Much more manageable and actionable.

## **Key Simplifications:**

### **From Complex → Simple**
- **8 phases → 3 phases**
- **Comprehensive coverage → 4-5 essential tools**
- **Enterprise complexity → ~200-300 lines of code**
- **Overwhelming detail → Clear priorities**

### **Clear Implementation Path:**
1. **Core MCP tools** (get_task_info, list_tasks, get_task_metrics, list_projects)
2. **PyPI packaging** (enable `pip install clearml-mcp`)
3. **Distribution** (Claude Desktop + Smithery)

### **PyPI + Smithery Strategy:**
You're right to think about both:
- **PyPI**: For developers who want to self-host and Claude Desktop integration
- **Smithery**: For AI agents to access through the marketplace gateway

They're complementary, not competing. PyPI gives you the traditional Python ecosystem, while Smithery gives you the AI agent ecosystem.

This simplified plan should be much easier to implement and won't overwhelm anyone helping you build it. The focus is on getting the core working first, then expanding distribution channels.

_**User**_

now its too minimal and doesn't have the full details around smithery. thats okay I can always do it later.

Buttttt you reduced scope of the mcp tool, which I dont want.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is right - I went too far in the simplification. They want:
1. Keep the comprehensive MCP tools (not just 4-5 basic ones)
2. Keep the Smithery integration details
3. But make it manageable for implementation

I need to find the right balance - comprehensive MCP tools and Smithery details, but organized in a way that's not overwhelming. Let me restore the full scope of MCP tools and Smithery integration while keeping the structure manageable.</details></think>

---

You're absolutely right! I oversimplified the MCP tools scope, which was the core value. Let me restore the comprehensive MCP tools and Smithery details while keeping it organized and manageable.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to restore the comprehensive Smithery integration details. The user wants both the full MCP tools scope AND the Smithery details, but organized in a manageable way.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I should also add back some of the Smithery optimization details that were in the original plan, but keep it organized and not overwhelming.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I should also update the implementation priority to reflect the more comprehensive scope, and update the success metrics.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I should also update the success metrics and the scope estimate to reflect the more comprehensive approach.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've restored the comprehensive scope while keeping it organized. Let me add one more thing - a summary of the comprehensive MCP tools that shows the full value proposition.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I have restored the comprehensive scope while keeping it organized and manageable. The plan now includes:

1. **Comprehensive MCP Tools** (12 tools instead of 4-5)
2. **Full Smithery Integration** with optimization details
3. **Organized Structure** that's not overwhelming
4. **Clear Implementation Priority**
5. **Realistic Scope** (~500-700 lines instead of the minimal 200-300)

This gives the user what they wanted - the full scope of MCP tools and Smithery details, but organized in a way that's implementable.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've restored the comprehensive scope while keeping it organized and manageable. Now you have:

## **✅ Comprehensive MCP Tools (12 tools)**
- **Task Operations** (5 tools): Full task lifecycle management
- **Model Operations** (3 tools): Model discovery, metadata, and artifacts
- **Project Operations** (2 tools): Project management and statistics
- **Analysis Tools** (2 tools): Task comparison and search

## **✅ Full Smithery Integration**
- Unified authentication and API gateway
- Marketplace optimization and SEO
- Multi-tenant support and hosted deployment
- Performance metrics and community engagement

## **✅ Balanced Scope**
- ~500-700 lines of core code (realistic but comprehensive)
- Clear implementation priority
- Both PyPI and Smithery distribution paths

## **Key Value Proposition**
Your ClearML MCP server will enable AI agents to:
- **Discover and analyze** ML experiments comprehensively
- **Compare model performance** across multiple tasks
- **Retrieve training metrics** and artifacts easily
- **Search and filter** projects and tasks efficiently
- **Get comprehensive model context** and lineage

This strikes the right balance - comprehensive enough to be truly useful for AI agents working with ClearML, but organized in a way that's not overwhelming to implement. The 12 tools cover all the major use cases an AI agent would need when working with ClearML data.

_**User**_

should we provide a command so `uvx clearml-mcp` works on stdio transport?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about providing a command that works with `uvx clearml-mcp` for stdio transport. This is actually a great question about the MCP server implementation.

Looking at the MCP quickstart documentation I saw earlier, MCP servers typically run with stdio transport for direct communication with Claude Desktop. The user is suggesting using `uvx` (which is uv's equivalent of `npx` for Python) to run the MCP server directly.

This would be really useful because:
1. It allows easy installation and running without needing to install the package globally
2. It works well with Claude Desktop's MCP server configuration
3. It's a modern Python distribution pattern

Looking at the current project structure, we have:
- `src/clearml_mcp/clearml_mcp.py` as the main module
- `pyproject.toml` already configured with hatchling

To make `uvx clearml-mcp` work, we need to:
1. Add a console script entry point in pyproject.toml
2. Make sure the main module can run as a script with stdio transport
3. Update the Claude Desktop configuration to use `uvx clearml-mcp`

This is actually a really good idea and aligns with modern Python tooling patterns.</details></think>

---

Absolutely! That's a fantastic idea and aligns perfectly with modern Python tooling. `uvx clearml-mcp` would make it super easy to run without global installation.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I should update the Claude Desktop configuration to show both options - the traditional pip install + command, and the modern uvx approach.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I should also add the implementation details for making this work in the pyproject.toml configuration section.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I should also update the core implementation to show that it needs a main() function for the console script entry point and stdio transport initialization.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>This is a great addition! Let me also update the implementation priority and usage examples to reflect this modern approach.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I should also update the section numbers since I added a new section. Let me fix that.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I should also update the implementation priority to mention the uvx support.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>



Let me also add a note about the benefits of the uvx approach.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! This is a great enhancement to the plan. The uvx approach is much cleaner and modern, and it makes the tool much more accessible for users who want to try it without committing to a global installation.

Let me also add a note about the convenience of this approach to the success metrics.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully updated the plan to include uvx support, which is a great addition. This makes the tool much more accessible and aligns with modern Python tooling patterns.

The key updates I made:
1. Added console script entry point in pyproject.toml
2. Added main() function for stdio transport
3. Updated Claude Desktop integration to show both uvx and pip install options
4. Added usage examples showing how to run with uvx
5. Updated implementation priorities and success metrics

This is a much better user experience - users can try the tool immediately with `uvx clearml-mcp` without any global installation, and it will always use the latest version. The uvx approach is becoming increasingly popular for Python tools, especially for MCP servers.</details></think>

---

Perfect! Yes, `uvx clearml-mcp` is a fantastic addition. This makes the tool much more accessible and follows modern Python tooling patterns.

## **Key Benefits of uvx Support:**

### **1. Zero Installation Trial**
- Users can try `uvx clearml-mcp` immediately without any global installation
- No environment pollution or conflicts

### **2. Always Latest Version**
- uvx automatically fetches the latest version from PyPI
- No need to manage updates manually

### **3. Isolated Environment**
- Each run gets its own isolated environment
- No dependency conflicts with other tools

### **4. Modern Python Tooling**
- Aligns with the modern Python ecosystem (uv/uvx)
- Same pattern as many other CLI tools

## **Implementation Details Added:**

### **1. Console Script Entry Point**
```toml
[project.scripts]
clearml-mcp = "clearml_mcp.clearml_mcp:main"
```

### **2. Main Function for stdio Transport**
```python
def main():
    """Entry point for uvx clearml-mcp"""
    mcp.run(transport='stdio')
```

### **3. Claude Desktop Integration Options**
- **Option 1 (Recommended):** `uvx clearml-mcp` - No installation needed
- **Option 2:** Traditional `pip install` then `clearml-mcp`

### **4. Easy Usage Examples**
```bash
# Just run it - no installation needed!
uvx clearml-mcp

# With environment variables
export CLEARML_ACCESS_KEY="your-key"
uvx clearml-mcp
```

This makes your ClearML MCP server incredibly accessible - users can literally try it in seconds without any setup beyond having their ClearML credentials. It's a great user experience that will encourage adoption!

_**User**_

what about security, how are we going to query project, etc. on remote servers ? on people's pc there is usually clearml.conf but clearml also respects env variables.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great question about security and configuration. The user is asking about how to handle authentication and configuration for ClearML when the MCP server is running in different environments:

1. Local usage (Claude Desktop) - can use clearml.conf or env variables
2. Remote usage (Smithery) - needs secure credential handling
3. Multi-tenant scenarios - need isolation

Let me think about the security considerations:

1. **Local Usage (Claude Desktop)**:
   - Can use existing clearml.conf file
   - Environment variables work
   - User controls their own credentials

2. **Smithery/Remote Usage**:
   - No access to local clearml.conf
   - Need secure credential storage
   - Multi-tenant isolation required
   - Credentials managed by Smithery

3. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Never hardcode credentials
   - Support multiple credential sources
   - Validate permissions
   - Audit logging
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation

I should update the GOALS.md to address these security concerns and configuration management strategies.</details></think>

---

Excellent security question! You're absolutely right - authentication and configuration are critical, especially when dealing with remote servers and multi-tenant scenarios. Let me add a comprehensive security section to the GOALS.md.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I should also add a section about specific implementation details for security, including how to handle the different deployment scenarios. Let me add that to the MCP tools implementation section.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me also add a section about specific security implementations for the different deployment scenarios (local vs Smithery) and how to handle multi-tenant scenarios.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me also add a section about specific security tools and validation that should be implemented in the MCP tools themselves.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me also add a section that explains the security validation that should be implemented in each MCP tool.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me also add a section to the usage examples that shows how to handle different security scenarios.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I should also update the section that was previously "3.2 Smithery Optimization" to be "3.4" now.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>



Let me also update the success metrics to reflect the comprehensive security considerations.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've now added comprehensive security considerations to the GOALS.md. Let me make sure the section about dependencies includes the os module for environment variable handling.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've now comprehensively addressed the security concerns around configuration and credential management for different deployment scenarios. Let me summarize what I've added:

1. **Multiple Configuration Sources** - in priority order (env vars, clearml.conf, Smithery managed)
2. **Security Considerations** - validation, scoping, rate limiting, audit logging
3. **Secure Initialization** - connection validation on startup
4. **Deployment-specific Security** - local vs Smithery scenarios
5. **Per-tool Security Validation** - input validation, permission checks, error sanitization
6. **Security Best Practices** - examples for different environments
7. **Multi-tenant Isolation** - for Smithery marketplace deployment

This covers the major security concerns around:
- Local usage with clearml.conf
- Environment variable configuration
- Remote/Smithery deployment with credential isolation
- Multi-tenant scenarios
- Permission validation and access control
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging and monitoring

The implementation plan now includes proper security from the ground up.</details></think>

---

Excellent security question! I've now added comprehensive security considerations to handle the different deployment scenarios and credential management approaches.

## **Key Security Enhancements Added:**

### **1. Multiple Configuration Sources (Priority Order)**
1. **Environment Variables** (highest priority) - for CI/CD and explicit configuration
2. **ClearML Config File** (`~/clearml.conf`) - for local development
3. **Smithery Managed Credentials** - for marketplace deployment

### **2. Deployment-Specific Security**

**Local Usage (Claude Desktop):**
- Can use existing `~/clearml.conf` file
- Environment variables override config file
- User controls their own credentials
- Connection validation on startup

**Smithery Deployment:**
- Managed credential storage through Smithery
- Multi-tenant isolation (each user's credentials isolated)
- Permission validation before accessing ClearML resources
- Rate limiting per user to prevent abuse

### **3. Security Validation in Every MCP Tool**
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize all task_ids, project_names, query parameters
- **Permission Checks:** Verify user has access to requested ClearML resources
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent excessive API calls
- **Error Sanitization:** Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Audit Logging:** Log all operations for security monitoring

### **4. Connection Initialization with Security**
```python
def initialize_clearml_connection():
    """Initialize and validate ClearML connection"""
    try:
        # Try environment variables first
        if os.getenv('CLEARML_ACCESS_KEY'):
            Task.set_credentials(...)
        # Otherwise, use clearml.conf (local usage)

        # Validate connection by testing project access
        projects = Task.get_projects()
        if not projects:
            raise ValueError("No ClearML projects accessible")
    except Exception as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to initialize ClearML connection: {str(e)}")
```

### **5. Security Best Practices Examples**
```bash
# Production with secure credential files
export CLEARML_ACCESS_KEY="$(cat /path/to/secure/access-key)"

# Development with read-only credentials
export CLEARML_ACCESS_KEY="read-only-access-key"

# Connection validation
clearml-mcp --validate-connection
```

## **This Addresses Your Concerns:**

1. **Local PCs:** Respects existing `~/clearml.conf` files and environment variables
2. **Remote Servers:** Secure credential management through Smithery
3. **Multi-tenant:** Proper credential isolation for marketplace deployment
4. **Permission Scoping:** Validates user access to requested ClearML resources
5. **Security Monitoring:** Comprehensive audit logging and rate limiting

The implementation now properly handles the spectrum from local development (where users have their own clearml.conf) to secure multi-tenant marketplace deployment (where Smithery manages credentials securely).

---

_**User**_

hmm local usage is easier because we can have only one path, i.e clearml.conf

Server is tricky, because the the access key and secret will have access to only that api. so if the user wants to call their clearml deployment, they'll need to pass their keys and url

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is making a good point about the security and configuration complexity. Let me think through this:

1. **Local usage**: Simple - just use the existing `~/clearml.conf` file that's already configured for their ClearML instance. This is the easiest path and what most users already have.

2. **Server/Smithery deployment**: More complex because:
   - Each user has their own ClearML deployment (different API servers)
   - Each user has their own access keys and secrets
   - The server needs to handle multiple users with different ClearML instances
   - We can't just use one set of credentials for everyone

So the user is right - for local usage, we should just use `clearml.conf` as the primary/only method since it's already configured and works.

For server deployment, we need to think about how users would pass their specific ClearML credentials and API server URL. This is more complex because we need to handle:
- Different API servers for different users
- Different credentials for different users
- Secure storage of these credentials
- Proper isolation between users

Let me simplify the local usage approach and clarify the server deployment complexity.</details></think>

---

You're absolutely right! I was overcomplicating it. Let me simplify this approach:

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, I've simplified the configuration approach. Now let me update the implementation to reflect this simpler approach for local usage, and acknowledge the complexity of server deployment.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I should also update the deployment-specific security section to reflect this simpler approach.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me also update the usage examples to reflect this simpler approach.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've simplified the approach significantly. Let me update the Claude Desktop integration options to reflect this simpler approach as well.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I've simplified the approach significantly. Now let me update the implementation priority to reflect this clarity.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've significantly simplified the approach based on the user's feedback. The key insights are:

1. **Local usage is simple**: Just use the existing `~/clearml.conf` file that ClearML users already have configured. This is the standard way ClearML works and we don't need to reinvent it.

2. **Server deployment is complex**: Each user has their own ClearML deployment with different API servers, access keys, and secret keys. This is a harder problem to solve and needs research into how Smithery handles multi-tenant credential management.

The simplified approach is much more practical and aligns with how ClearML actually works in practice.</details></think>

---

Perfect! You're absolutely right. I was overcomplicating the authentication story. Let me summarize the simplified approach:

## **✅ Simplified Authentication Strategy**

### **Local Usage (Claude Desktop) - Simple!**
- **One path:** Use existing `~/clearml.conf` file
- **Already configured:** ClearML users already have this set up
- **No complexity:** ClearML SDK handles everything automatically
- **Just works:** `uvx clearml-mcp` and it uses their existing configuration

### **Server Deployment (Smithery) - Complex**
- **Real challenge:** Each user has their own ClearML deployment
- **Different servers:** User A has `https://company-a.clearml.com`, User B has `https://company-b.clearml.com`
- **Different credentials:** Each user needs their own access key + secret key
- **Multi-tenant problem:** How do users securely provide their specific credentials?

## **This Approach is Much Better Because:**

1. **Local is frictionless** - Users don't need to learn new credential management
2. **Leverages existing setup** - Uses the standard ClearML configuration they already have
3. **Identifies the real complexity** - Server deployment is genuinely harder and needs research
4. **Honest about challenges** - We acknowledge the Smithery credential management as "TBD"

## **Implementation becomes:**

**Phase 1:** Build MCP tools that work with standard ClearML SDK configuration
**Phase 2:** Package for PyPI with `uvx clearml-mcp` support
**Phase 3:** Deploy locally via Claude Desktop (works with existing clearml.conf)
**Phase 4:** Research Smithery's multi-tenant credential patterns for server deployment

This is much more realistic and aligns with how ClearML actually works in practice. Users already have their `~/clearml.conf` configured - we just need to use it!

---

_**User**_

actually just scrap the smithery approach altogether. lets keep uvx only . keeps things simple, right?

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is absolutely right. They want to keep things simple and focused. The Smithery approach was adding a lot of complexity without necessarily providing clear value for the initial version. Let me remove all the Smithery-related content and focus purely on the local uvx approach. This makes the plan much cleaner and more focused.

I need to:
1. Remove all Smithery-related sections
2. Simplify the goals to focus on local uvx usage
3. Update the phases to remove Smithery deployment
4. Clean up the implementation priority
5. Update success metrics
6. Keep the focus on the core MCP tools and PyPI/uvx distribution

This will make the plan much more actionable and focused.</details></think>

---

Absolutely! You're 100% right. Let's keep it simple and focused. Smithery was adding unnecessary complexity for the initial version. Let me clean up the GOALS.md to focus purely on the uvx approach.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully stripped out all the Smithery complexity and focused the plan on the simple uvx approach. This makes the project much more focused and actionable:

**Key improvements:**
1. **Removed all Smithery references** - no more complex multi-tenant credential management
2. **Simplified goals** - just focus on local uvx usage
3. **Single deployment method** - uvx only, no pip install option
4. **Clear prerequisites** - users need existing clearml.conf
5. **Focused phases** - just 3 phases instead of 8
6. **Simple philosophy** - one deployment method, one configuration approach

The plan is now much cleaner and more realistic. The user can focus on building the core MCP tools and getting them working with uvx, without worrying about complex deployment scenarios.</details></think>

Perfect! 🎯 Much cleaner and more focused. The plan is now:

## **✅ Simplified & Actionable**

### **What We Kept:**
- **12 comprehensive MCP tools** (the core value)
- **uvx clearml-mcp** (simple deployment)
- **Claude Desktop integration** (main use case)
- **Existing clearml.conf** (leverages what users already have)

### **What We Removed:**
- ❌ Smithery complexity
- ❌ Multi-tenant credential management
- ❌ Environment variable juggling
- ❌ Server deployment concerns
- ❌ Multiple installation methods

### **Result:**
- **3 focused phases** instead of 8 overwhelming ones
- **One deployment method** - uvx only
- **One configuration approach** - existing clearml.conf
- **Clear prerequisites** - users need working ClearML setup
- **Simple philosophy** - deliver value to ClearML users who want AI agent access

## **Implementation Path is Now Crystal Clear:**

1. **Build MCP tools** → Use ClearML SDK with standard configuration
2. **Package for PyPI** → Enable `uvx clearml-mcp`
3. **Claude Desktop** → Single JSON config pointing to uvx
4. **Document** → Setup guide and usage examples

**User Experience:**
```bash
# That's it! No complex setup, no credential management
uvx clearml-mcp
```

This approach is much more likely to succeed because it's focused, simple, and leverages what ClearML users already have configured. Great call to simplify! 🚀
