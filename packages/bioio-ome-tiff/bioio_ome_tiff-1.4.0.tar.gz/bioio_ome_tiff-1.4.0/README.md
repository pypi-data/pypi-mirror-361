A BioIO reader plugin for reading OME TIFF files using `tifffile`

---


## Documentation

[See the full documentation on our GitHub pages site](https://bioio-devs.github.io/bioio/OVERVIEW.html) - the generic use and installation instructions there will work for this package.

Information about the base reader this package relies on can be found in the `bioio-base` repository [here](https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio-base)

## Installation

**Stable Release:** `pip install bioio-ome-tiff`<br>
**Development Head:** `pip install git+https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio-ome-tiff.git`

## Example Usage (see full documentation for more examples)

Install bioio-ome-tiff alongside bioio:

`pip install bioio bioio-ome-tiff`


This example shows a simple use case for just accessing the pixel data of the image
by explicitly passing this `Reader` into the `BioImage`. Passing the `Reader` into
the `BioImage` instance is optional as `bioio` will automatically detect installed
plug-ins and auto-select the most recently installed plug-in that supports the file
passed in.
```python
from bioio import BioImage
import bioio_ome_tiff

img = BioImage("my_file.ome.tiff", reader=bioio_ome_tiff.Reader)
img.data
```

## OmeTiffWriter

Import for the writer:

```python
from bioio_ome_tiff.writers import OmeTiffWriter
```

The `OmeTiffWriter` lets you save image data to OME-TIFF files, supporting:

* Single- or multi-scene datasets with explicit dimension order
* Custom channel names, colors, and physical pixel sizes
* Automatic generation and validation of OME-XML metadata
* BigTIFF output for large (>2 GB) images

### Example Usage

```python
# Write a TCZYX dataset to OME-TIFF
image = numpy.ndarray([1, 10, 3, 1024, 2048])
OmeTiffWriter.save(image, "file.ome.tif")
```

```python
# Write data with a specific dimension order
image = numpy.ndarray([10, 3, 1024, 2048])
OmeTiffWriter.save(image, "file.ome.tif", dim_order="ZCYX")
```

```python
# Write multi-scene data, specifying channel names
image0 = numpy.ndarray([3, 10, 1024, 2048])
image1 = numpy.ndarray([3, 10, 512, 512])
OmeTiffWriter.save(
    [image0, image1],
    "file.ome.tif",
    dim_order="CZYX",  # will be applied to both scenes
    channel_names=[["C00", "C01", "C02"], ["C10", "C11", "C12"]],
)
```

```python
# Write data with a custom compression scheme
image = numpy.ndarray([1, 10, 3, 1024, 2048])
OmeTiffWriter.save(
    image,
    "file.ome.tif",
    tifffile_kwargs={
        "compression": "zlib",
        "compressionargs": {"level": 8},
    },
)
```
