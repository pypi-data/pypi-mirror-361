# gitskan

A CLI tool for scanning directories and displaying Git repository status information. `gitskan` is a fork of [gits-statuses](https://github.com/nicolgit/gits-statuses) which provides a comprehensive overview of all your Git repositories in a clean, tabular format.

Notes:
- This fork was catalyzed by this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nicolgit/gits-statuses/issues/1)
- This is meant to implement the exact functionality but in a single CLI executable
- Renamed to `gitskan` as to not conflict with `gits-statuses` and to further simplify CLI command
  - Executable name in CLI: `gsk`

## Features

This scans your directories and displays:

**Standard View:**
- Repository name
- Current branch
- Commits ahead of remote
- Commits behind remote  
- Changed files count
- Untracked files count
- Only shows repositories with changes (clean repos are hidden)

**Detailed View:**
- All columns from standard view
- Total commits count
- Status summary (e.g., "↑1 ~2 ?3" for 1 ahead, 2 changed, 3 untracked)
- Remote URL
- Shows ALL repositories (including clean ones)

**Enhanced Summary:**
- Total repositories found
- Repositories with changes
- Repositories ahead of remote
- Repositories behind remote
- Repositories with untracked files

## Installation

### Prerequisites
