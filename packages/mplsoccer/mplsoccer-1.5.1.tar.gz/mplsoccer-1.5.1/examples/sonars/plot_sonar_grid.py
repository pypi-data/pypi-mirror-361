==========
Sonar Grid
==========
StatsBomb has a great
`blog <https://statsbomb.com/articles/soccer/a-sneak-peak-at-iq-tactics-a-brief-history-of-radials-sonars-wagon-wheels-in-soccer/>`_
on the history of Sonars. Sonars show more information than heatmaps
by introducing the angle of passes, shots or other events.

The following examples show how to use the ``sonar_grid`` method to plot
a grid of sonars. I have copied a layout by `Ted Knutson <https://x.com/mixedknuts>`_ the founder
of StatsBomb. However, I encourage you to try out your variations as the API
allows you to mix and match different metrics for setting the slice length
and colors. Given the huge array of possible combinations, you should also
add a key to explain the viz because there isnâ€™t a single standard for Sonars.

More information is available on how to customize the grid cells and segments in
:ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_sonars_plot_bin_statistic_sonar.py`.
