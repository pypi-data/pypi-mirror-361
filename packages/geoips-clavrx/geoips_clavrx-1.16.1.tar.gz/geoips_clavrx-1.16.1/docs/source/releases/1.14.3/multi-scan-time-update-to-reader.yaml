    Based on *GEOIPS#796: 2024-10-09, AMI and EWSG Refactor: Multi-scan time functionality*

    Updated the clavrx_hdf4 reader to handle mutliple scan times if provided. Now a user
    can provide one or more clavrx files from a certain sensor and perform calculations
    on datasets taken at different scan times if wanted.

    These changes are dependent on the aforementioned PR, so do not merge this until
    that PR has been merged to main. Added a new algorithm, product, and test script
    which makes use of the multi-scan time functionality.
