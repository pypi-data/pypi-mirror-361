    Starting with this release, we removed checks for the
    LVM features having versions < 2.02.115. It includes
    the following:

    * LV activation support (2.02.91)
    * Thin provisioning (2.02.95)
    * --ignoreactivationskip (2.02.99)
    * lvcreate -l 100%FREE (2.02.115)

    Now the minimum supported LVM version is 2.02.115 which
    was released in 2015.
