## About

for the search (SEO/SEM) and digital marketing practitioner. It aims to
help with various productivity and analysis tools.

Part of the analysis process is producing specialized charts that tend
to come up all the time. So, `adviz` aims to be a collection of charts
that can help `advertools` users. Many of the charts can be used for
many other workflows, and are not marketing-specific. Feel free to use,
share, and suggest features for any of them.
