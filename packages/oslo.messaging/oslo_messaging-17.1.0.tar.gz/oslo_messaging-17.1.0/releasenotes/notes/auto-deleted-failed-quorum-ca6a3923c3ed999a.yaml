    Auto-delete the failed quorum rabbit queues.
    When rabbit is failing for a specific quorum queue, delete the queue
    before trying to recreate it.
    This may happen if the queue is not recoverable on rabbit side.
    See https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html#availability for more
    info on this specific case.
