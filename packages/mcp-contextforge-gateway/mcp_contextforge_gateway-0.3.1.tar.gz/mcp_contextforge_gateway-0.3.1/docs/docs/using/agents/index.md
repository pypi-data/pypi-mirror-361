# Agent Integrations

This section provides guidance on integrating various AI agent frameworks with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway. MCP enables agents to dynamically discover and utilize tools across multiple servers, enhancing their capabilities and flexibility.

## üß† Supported Agent Frameworks

- [LangChain](langchain.md): Utilize MCP tools within LangChain agents using the `langchain-mcp-adapters` package.
- [LangGraph](langgraph.md): Integrate MCP tools into LangGraph agents for advanced workflow orchestration.
- [CrewAI](crewai.md): Connect CrewAI agents to MCP servers using the `crewai-tools` library.
- [Bee Agent Framework](bee.md): Leverage MCP tools within the Bee Agent Framework for scalable agent deployments.
- [AutoGen](autogen.md): Integrate MCP tools with AutoGen agents using the `autogen-ext-mcp` package.
- [LlamaIndex](llamaindex.md): Incorporate MCP tools into LlamaIndex workflows for enhanced data retrieval and question answering.
- [OpenAI Agents SDK](openai-sdk.md): Utilize MCP tools within OpenAI's Agents SDK for building AI agents with standardized tool access.
- [Semantic Kernel](semantic-kernel.md): Connect Semantic Kernel agents to MCP servers for enriched context and tool integration.
