# Kreuzberg

Kreuzberg is a complete Open Source Document Intelligence framework. Its Built by engineers for production workloads -
its not a data science / research orientated tool, but rather a pragmatic swiss-army knife that is meant to deliver.
Yes, Python, when coupled with robust technologies such as `pdfium`, `tesseract` and `pandoc` can do quite a lot.
Kreuzberg was also created (primarily) in Kreuzberg - the famous and beautiful neighborhood of Berlin.

## Why Kreuzberg?

At the danger of over-selling, there are actually quite a lot of reasons why use Kreuzberg. You can read them below.
BUT - this is not necessarily a mutually exclusive solution. For example.
many text extraction pipelines can integrate a library such as Kreuzberg with some kind of heuristics on when to use it
and when use something else.
