  - |
    NVMe-oF connector `bug #1964395
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1964395>`_: Fixed dependence on a
    specific nvme cli version for proper detection of devices when attaching a
    volume.

  - |
    NVMe-oF connector `bug #1964388
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1964388>`_: Fixed corner case
    where it could return the wrong path for a volume, resulting in attaching
    in Nova the wrong volume to an instance, destroying volume data in Cinder,
    and other similarly dangerous scenarios.

  - |
    NVMe-oF connector `bug #1964385
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1964385>`_: Fixed disappearance
    of volumes/devices from the host, with potential data loss of unflushed
    data, when network issues last longer than 10 minutes.

  - |
    NVMe-oF connector `bug #1964380
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1964380>`_: Fixed support for
    newer nvme cli exit code when trying to connect to an already
    subsystem-portal.

    NVMe-oF connector `bug #1964383
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1964383>`_: Fixed not being able
    to attach a volume if there was already a controller for the subsystem.

  - |
    NVMe-oF connector `bug #1965954
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1965954>`_: Fixed extend of
    in-use replicated volumes with a single replica not growing the RAID

  - |
    NVMe-oF connector `bug #1964590
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1964590>`_: Fixed extend failure
    of in-use volumes with some Cinder drivers.
