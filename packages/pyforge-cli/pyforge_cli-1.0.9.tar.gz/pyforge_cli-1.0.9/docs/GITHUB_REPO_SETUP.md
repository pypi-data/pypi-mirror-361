# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Fix GitHub Repository Display Issues

### 1. Add Package Information to Repository

Go to your repository settings:
1. Navigate to https://github.com/Py-Forge-Cli/PyForge-CLI
2. Click on the gear icon (⚙️) next to "About" on the right side
3. Update the following:
   - **Description**: A powerful CLI tool for data format conversion and synthetic data generation
   - **Website**: https://pypi.org/project/pyforge-cli/
   - **Topics**: Add these tags:
     - `cli`
     - `data-conversion`
     - `pdf`
     - `excel`
     - `parquet`
     - `python`
     - `database`
     - `mdb`
     - `dbf`

### 2. Fix Deployments/Environments

The "failed" deployments are from trying to use GitHub Environments that weren't configured. To clean this up:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Environments**
2. Delete any environments that show as failed (testpypi, pypi)
3. The deployments section will then show correctly

### 3. Add Packages Section

To make the Packages section appear:

1. Your package is already published to PyPI
2. GitHub will automatically detect and link PyPI packages if:
   - The repository URL in your `pyproject.toml` matches your GitHub repo ✅
   - The package is published to PyPI ✅
   
The package section should appear automatically within a few hours. If not:
- Go to **Settings** → **Pages** (even though we're not using Pages)
- Scroll down to **Packages**
- You can manually link your PyPI package

### 4. Add Release Notes

For the v0.2.1 release:

1. Go to https://github.com/Py-Forge-Cli/PyForge-CLI/releases
2. Click on the v0.2.1 tag
3. Click "Create release from tag"
4. Add release notes:
