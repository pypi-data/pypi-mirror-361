ad-rss-map-integration provides a python binding of the C++ example implementation for integrating Responsibility Sensitive Safety model (RSS) with automated driving maps. When RSS is to be integrated into a larger system it is usually up to the user implementation to provide the required input into RSS based on the environment information available within the system. The [*ad_rss_map_integration*](https://intel.github.io/ad-rss-lib/ad_rss_map_integration/Main/) library provides an example C++ implementation for integrating RSS with automated driving maps.
