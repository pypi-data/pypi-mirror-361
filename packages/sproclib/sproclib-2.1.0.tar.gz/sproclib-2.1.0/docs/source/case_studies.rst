Overview
--------

These case studies demonstrate how SPROCLIB solves real industrial challenges:

* **Complete implementations** with actual process data
* **Performance comparisons** before and after SPROCLIB implementation
* **Economic analysis** showing ROI and operational improvements
* **Lessons learned** and best practices from each project
* **Scalability considerations** for different plant sizes

Each case study includes:

- **Problem Description** - Original challenges and requirements
- **Solution Approach** - How SPROCLIB was applied
- **Implementation Details** - Complete code and configuration
- **Results Analysis** - Performance metrics and improvements
- **Economic Impact** - Cost savings and operational benefits
