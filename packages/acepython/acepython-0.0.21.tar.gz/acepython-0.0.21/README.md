## Introduction

ACEPython is a Python wrapper for the FORTRAN equilibrium chemistry code developed by [Ag√∫ndez et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...548A..73A/abstract). It can rapidly compute the equilibirum chemical scheme for a given temperature and pressure.

### Installation

ACEPython can be installed with prebuilt wheels using pip:

```bash
pip install acepython
```

Or, if you prefer, you can build it from source which requires a FORTRAN and C compiler. The following commands will build and install ACEPython:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/acepython.git
cd acepython
pip install .
```

## Usage

ACEPython can be used to compute the equilibrium chemistry for a given temperature and pressure. Temperature and pressure must be created with astropy units. For pressure, any unit can be used (Pa, bar etc). The following example shows how to compute the equilibrium chemistry for a column of atmosphere:

```python
from acepython import run_ace
from astropy import units as u
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


temperature = np.linspace(3000, 1000, 100) << u.K
pressure = np.logspace(6, -2, 100) << u.bar

species, mix_profile, mu_profile = run_ace(
    temperature,
    pressure,
)

species_to_see = ["H2", "H20", "CH4", "NH3", "C2H2", "CO", "CO2", "H2CO"]

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))

for i, spec in enumerate(species):
    if spec in species_to_see:
        ax1.plot(mix_profile[i], pressure, label=spec)

ax1.set_yscale("log")
ax1.set_xscale("log")
ax1.invert_yaxis()
ax1.set_ylabel("Pressure (bar)")
ax1.set_xlabel("VMR")

ax1.legend()

ax2.plot(mu_profile, pressure)
ax2.set_yscale("log")
ax2.invert_yaxis()
ax2.set_ylabel("Pressure (bar)")
ax2.set_xlabel("Mean molecular weight (au)")

plt.show()
```

Should produce the following figure:

### Custom chemical scheme

By default the elements in the chemical scheme are <mark>H, He, C, N, O</mark> at log abundances <mark>12, 10.93, 8.39, 7.86, 8.73</mark> respectively. The abundances can be changed by passing the elements and corresponding abundances to the `run_ace` function:

```python
species, mix_profile, mu_profile = run_ace(
    temperature,
    pressure,
    elements=["H", "He", "C", "N", "O"],
    abundances=[12, 10.93, 8.39, 7.86, 7.73],
)
```

where we have changed *O* to have a log abundance of *7.73*.

You can customize the species included by passing in thermochemical and species data files.

For example, if we have a custom thermochemical data file called `custom_thermochemical_data.dat` and a custom species data file called `custom_species_data.dat` that includes sulphur we can run ACEPython with:

```python
species, mix_profile, mu_profile = run_ace(
    temperature,
    pressure,
    elements=["H", "He", "C", "N", "O", "S"],
    abundances=[12, 10.93, 8.39, 7.86, 7.73, 7.0],
    thermochemical_data="custom_thermochemical_data_w_S.dat",
    species_data="custom_species_data_w_S.dat",
)
```

## TauREx3

ACEPython also includes a plugin for [TauREx 3.1](https://taurex3-public.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that allows you to use ACEPython as a chemistry scheme. In the input file you can select it in the *Chemistry* section using <mark>acepython</mark> with arguments:

```bash
[Chemistry]
chemistry = acepython
# He/H ratio (optional)
he_h_ratio = 0.83
# Elements excluding H, He (optional)
elements = C, N, O  
# log abundances (optional)
abundances = 8.39, 7.86, 8.73 
# Custom species data file (optional)
spec_file = custom_species_data.dat 
# Custom thermochemical data file (optional)
thermo_file = custom_thermochemical_data.dat 
```
