    """FBRAIN3LS - Nonlinear Least-Squares problem for brain tissue modeling.

    This problem involves fitting a model of the shear stress in human brain tissue
    to experimental data, formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem.

    The model function is:
    f(λ) = C0_1 * λ^(2*α_1-1) + C0_2 * λ^(2*α_2-1) + C0_3 * λ^(2*α_3-1)

    where λ represents the shear deformation ratio.
