"""Frequenz Channels.

This package contains
[channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(programming)) implementations.

<!-- For the full documentation and user guide please visit the [project's
website](https://frequenz-floss.github.io/frequenz-channels-python/) -->

Base classes:

* [Receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver]: An object that can wait for and
  consume messages from a channel.

* [Sender][frequenz.channels.Sender]: An object that can send messages to
  a channel.

Channels:

* [Anycast][frequenz.channels.Anycast]: A channel that supports multiple
  senders and multiple receivers.  A message sent through a sender will be
  received by exactly one receiver.

* [Broadcast][frequenz.channels.Broadcast]: A channel to broadcast messages
  from multiple senders to multiple receivers. Each message sent through any of
  the senders is received by all of the receivers.

Utilities to work with channels:

* [merge][frequenz.channels.merge]: Merge messages coming from multiple receivers into
  a single stream.

* [select][frequenz.channels.select]: Iterate over the messages of all
  [receivers][frequenz.channels.Receiver] as new messages become available.

* [LatestValueCache][frequenz.channels.LatestValueCache]: A cache that stores
  the latest value in a receiver, providing a way to look up the latest value in
  a stream, without having to wait, as long as there has been one value
  received.

Exception classes:

* [Error][frequenz.channels.Error]: Base class for all errors in this
  library.

* [ChannelError][frequenz.channels.ChannelError]: Base class for all errors
  related to channels.

* [ChannelClosedError][frequenz.channels.ChannelClosedError]: Error raised when
  trying to operate (send, receive, etc.) through a closed channel.

* [SenderError][frequenz.channels.SenderError]: Base class for all errors
  related to senders.

* [ReceiverError][frequenz.channels.ReceiverError]: Base class for all errors
  related to receivers.

* [ReceiverStoppedError][frequenz.channels.ReceiverStoppedError]: A receiver
  stopped producing messages.

* [SelectError][frequenz.channels.SelectError]: Base class for all errors
    related to [select][frequenz.channels.select].

* [UnhandledSelectedError][frequenz.channels.UnhandledSelectedError]: An error
    raised by [select][frequenz.channels.select] that was not handled by the
    user.

Extra utility receivers:

* [Event][frequenz.channels.event.Event]: A receiver that generates a message when
  an event is set.

* [FileWatcher][frequenz.channels.file_watcher.FileWatcher]: A receiver that
  generates a message when a file is added, modified or deleted.

* [Timer][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer]: A receiver that generates a message after a
  given amount of time.
