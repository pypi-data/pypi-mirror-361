#4 : Documenting Django applications with Sphinx
------------------------------------------------

When documenting Django applications with Sphinx and `sphinx.ext.autodoc` arises the problem that 
 autodoc fails to import your modules::

  (WARNING/2) autodoc can't import/find module 'mypackage.mymod', \
  it reported error: "Settings cannot be imported, because environment \
  variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is undefined.", please check your \
  spelling and sys.path

This is correct since `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not defined.

Okay, I can just manually do a 
``set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=mymodule.settings`` before running ``make html``.

How can I define an environment variable in the Makefile? The following doesn't work::

  html:
          set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=dsbe.demo.settings
          $(SPHINXBUILD) -b html -d $(CACHEDIR) $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) . $(BUILDDIR)

This is because each command line is executed in her own environment 
("`When it is time to execute commands to update a target, they are 
executed by making a new subshell for each line. 
<http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/make-3.79.1/html_chapter/make_5.html#SEC46>`__")

And the same section of the GNU Make manual also explains how to do it: 
put both commands into a single line, separating them with ";"::

  html:
          set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=dsbe.demo.settings ; \
          $(SPHINXBUILD) -b html -d $(CACHEDIR) $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) . $(BUILDDIR)

But this still doesn't work. 
My guess is that Sphinx launches autodoc in a separate process and doesn't forward its environment...
