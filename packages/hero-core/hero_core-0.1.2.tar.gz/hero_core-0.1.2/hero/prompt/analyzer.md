    ]

<basic_rules>

- You need based on the `demand` and `reference_file` to find the specific line number to be modified in the `original_file`.
- You need to return the line numbers in the `line_numbers` field in the `return_format`.
    - The `line_numbers` field is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains two fields: `start` and `end`.
    - The `start` field is the start line number of the modification.
    - The `end` field is the end line number of the modification.
    - The `start` and `end` field are both integers.
- You need to accurately count the number of lines in the `original_file` and ensure that the line numbers of the modifications in the patch file are correct. For example:
    <line_number_example>
    1: import numpy as np
    2: 
    3: GRID_LEN = 4
    </line_number_example>
    the 1, 2, 3 is the line number of the file. So do not take the line number to the patch file.
