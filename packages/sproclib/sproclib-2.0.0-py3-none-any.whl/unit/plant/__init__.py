"""
Plant Package for SPROCLIB - Process Plant Design and Optimization

This package provides high-level plant design capabilities with semantic APIs
similar to TensorFlow/Keras for intuitive chemical plant construction.

Classes:
    ChemicalPlant: Main plant container and orchestrator
    ProcessUnit: Base class for all process equipment
    Stream: Material and energy stream connections
    PlantOptimizer: Plant-wide optimization framework
