- List any alternative solutions you've considered

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through these issues:

- Issues labeled `good first issue` - should only require a few lines of code
- Issues labeled `help wanted` - more involved but still accessible

### Pull Requests

   git clone https://github.com/aoneahsan/rapid-crawl.git
   cd rapid-crawl
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install in development mode:**

   ```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting (line length: 100)
- **Ruff** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

Before committing:

```bash
# Format code
black src/rapidcrawl tests

# Run linter
ruff check src/rapidcrawl tests

# Type checking
mypy src/rapidcrawl
```

**Key Style Points:**

1. Use type hints for all function signatures
2. Write docstrings for all public functions/classes (Google style)
3. Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
4. Use descriptive variable names
5. Follow PEP 8 with Black's modifications

**Example:**

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any

def scrape_url(
    self,
    url: str,
    formats: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    timeout: int = 30000
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Scrape a URL and return its content.
    
    Args:
        url: The URL to scrape.
        formats: List of output formats (markdown, html, etc.).
        timeout: Request timeout in milliseconds.
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing scraped content and metadata.
        
    Raises:
        ScrapingError: If the URL cannot be scraped.
        ValidationError: If the URL is invalid.
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat: add PDF extraction support to scraper
fix: handle timeout errors in async crawler
docs: update API reference for search feature
test: add unit tests for URL validation
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=rapidcrawl --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_scrape.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_scrape.py::TestScraper::test_basic_scraping
```

### Writing Tests

1. Place tests in the `tests/` directory
2. Name test files with `test_` prefix
3. Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
4. Include both positive and negative test cases
5. Mock external dependencies

**Example test:**

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from rapidcrawl import RapidCrawlApp
from rapidcrawl.exceptions import ScrapingError


class TestScraper:
    def test_scrape_url_success(self):
        """Test successful URL scraping."""
        app = RapidCrawlApp()
        
        with patch.object(app.scraper, '_make_request') as mock_request:
            mock_request.return_value.text = "<h1>Test</h1>"
            
            result = app.scrape_url("https://example.com")
            
            assert result.success is True
            assert "Test" in result.content["markdown"]
    
    def test_scrape_url_invalid_url(self):
        """Test scraping with invalid URL."""
        app = RapidCrawlApp()
        
        with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
            app.scrape_url("not-a-url")
```

## Documentation

### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def function_name(param1: str, param2: int = 0) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of function.
    
    Longer description if needed. Explain what the function does,
    any important details, etc.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1.
        param2: Description of param2. Defaults to 0.
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value.
        
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: Description of when this exception is raised.
        
    Example:
        >>> function_name("test", 42)
        True
    """
    pass
```

### Updating Documentation

When making changes:

1. Update docstrings for any modified functions/classes
2. Update README.md if adding new features
3. Update API.md for API changes
4. Add examples to EXAMPLES.md for new functionality
5. Update CHANGELOG.md
