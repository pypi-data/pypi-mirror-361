    """Raster tool that computes the Sky View Factor (SVF) of a
    Digital Elevation / Surface / Height Model.

    Kokalj, Å½iga & all 2013:

    SVF is a geophysical parameter that measures the portion of the sky visible from a certain
    point. The portion of the sky visible above the surface is especially relevant in energy balance
    studies and computation of diffuse solar insolation.

    Sky-view factor is defined as the proportion of visible sky (:math:`\\Omega`) above a certain
    observation point as seen from a two-dimensional representation.

    The light that falls from the sky onto a certain part of the surface is reduced by the obstacles
    that form the horizon. These obstacles can be described in all directions by the vertical
    elevation angle above the horizontal plane.

    A good SVF approximation can therefore be performed with the estimate of this angle
    in several directions. After the vertical elevation angle is determined in the chosen
    number of directions n, the SVF is determined as a sum of all portions of the sky within
    each direction: :math:`\\sum \\frac {\\cos \\gamma_i}{n}`, where :math:`\\gamma_i` is the
    vertical angle of the horizon in the`direction i.

    The angle :math:`\\gamma` is extracted from the Digital Model:
    :math:`\\tan \\frac{Height}{Distance}`::

          <-------------->
              Distance

    Where p is the current pixel where the SVF is computed.

    In a direction, the algorithm computes all angles and keeps the largest one. To avoid testing
    too many points, the "radius" parameter defines the max distance of the pixel to test.

    The output image of SVF rastertool is a raster image with the SVF value computed at every pixels
    of the input Digital Elevation Model.
