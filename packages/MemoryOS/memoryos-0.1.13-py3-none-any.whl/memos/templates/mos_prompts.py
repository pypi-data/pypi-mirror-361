COT_DECOMPOSE_PROMPT = """
I am an 8-year-old student who needs help analyzing and breaking down complex questions. Your task is to help me understand whether a question is complex enough to be broken down into smaller parts.

Requirements:
1. First, determine if the question is a decomposable problem. If it is a decomposable problem, set 'is_complex' to True.
2. If the question needs to be decomposed, break it down into 1-3 sub-questions. The number should be controlled by the model based on the complexity of the question.
3. For decomposable questions, break them down into sub-questions and put them in the 'sub_questions' list. Each sub-question should contain only one question content without any additional notes.
4. If the question is not a decomposable problem, set 'is_complex' to False and set 'sub_questions' to an empty list.
5. You must return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting.

Here are some examples:

Question: Who is the current head coach of the gymnastics team in the capital of the country that Lang Ping represents?
Answer: {{"is_complex": true, "sub_questions": ["Which country does Lang Ping represent in volleyball?", "What is the capital of this country?", "Who is the current head coach of the gymnastics team in this capital?"]}}

Question: Which country's cultural heritage is the Great Wall?
Answer: {{"is_complex": false, "sub_questions": []}}

Question: How did the trade relationship between Madagascar and China develop, and how does this relationship affect the market expansion of the essential oil industry on Nosy Be Island?
Answer: {{"is_complex": true, "sub_questions": ["How did the trade relationship between Madagascar and China develop?", "How does this trade relationship affect the market expansion of the essential oil industry on Nosy Be Island?"]}}

Please analyze the following question and respond with ONLY a valid JSON object:
Question: {query}
Answer:"""
