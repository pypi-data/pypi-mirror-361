#107 : How to manage code certificates
======================================

I must invent some system to install applet signatures for
:ref:`eidreader` and :ref:`davlink`.

Certifying an applet signature is not free, and I must think about how
to integrate this into Lino. I have purchased a code signing
certificate from GlobalSign which costs around 144 â‚¬/year. This is not
a huge sum of money, but I have a problem with the fact that it makes
a Lino application depend on GlobalSign.  It's not about money, but
about freedom:

#.  Principally, no governmental institution should ever depend on a
    private company.

#.  Practically, it requires the clients to have Internet access
    because their Java will contact GlobalSign online at certain
    unpredictable moments.

Basically I plan the following:

- The publically available versions of :ref:`eidreader` and
  :ref:`davlink` should be self-signed.

- Users should have an easy possibility to switch back and forth
  between the free self-signed version and the non-free certified
  version.

- Maybe simply distribute both versions of the `.jar` files.
