## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're looking to improve our datasets, train better models, or build new tools on top of our work, feel free to open a pull request or start a discussion.

### How to Contribute (for repository maintainers)

If you are interested in helping maintain or add to the repository, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/YourFeature)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add YourFeature')
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/YourFeature)
5. Open a pull request

#### Dependency Managing
This repository uses poetry for more intuitive management of package installation. Here's how to get it set up in your environment:

```bash
pip install poetry==2.1.2
```

Once poetry is installed, it's recommended to use a virtual environment to prevent dependency conflicts. Here's how you can do it with poetry:

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install  # If you are contributing to a streamlit app or unit tests, add the `--with dev` flag
source .venv/bin/activate
```

This creates a virtual environment in your project directory and the dependencies required to operate the package. If you are adding new dependencies, simply write:

```bash
poetry add ____  # library name
```

The dependency is automatically updated, so you don't have to worry about adding it manually to a `requirements.txt` file. 
If you want a specific python version:

```bash
poetry env use ___  # python version
poetry run python --version
```

### How to Contribute (for supporters)

Our main need is for data annotation. With our new annotation app, you can help us annotate certain datasets. To do so, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the App: [Annotation App](https://balldatalab.com/streamlit/baseballcv_annotation_app/)
2. Enter a Username and Email
3. Open Existing Project
4. Select a Dataset (as of right now, we need with `player_detection`)
5. Open the Annotation Interface and begin annotating!
