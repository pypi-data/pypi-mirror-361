## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
import floodr

async def main():
    # Simple parallel GET requests
    urls = [
        "https://api.github.com/users/github",
        "https://api.github.com/users/torvalds",
        "https://api.github.com/users/rust-lang"
    ]
    
    responses = await floodr.get(urls)
    
    for url, resp in zip(urls, responses):
        data = resp.json()
        print(f"{data['name']} has {data['public_repos']} public repos")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## API Reference

The floodr library provides a modern API using Pydantic models for request/response handling:

```python
from floodr import Request, Response, request

# Create requests with Pydantic validation
requests = [
    Request(url="https://httpbin.org/get"),
    Request(
        url="https://httpbin.org/post",
        method="POST",
        json={"key": "value"},
        headers={"X-Custom": "header"}
    ),
    Request(
        url="https://httpbin.org/get",
        params={"search": "query", "page": "1"}
    ),
]

# Execute multiple requests in parallel
responses = await request(requests)

# Access response data
for resp in responses:
    print(f"Status: {resp.status_code}")
    print(f"Headers: {resp.headers}")
    print(f"Content: {resp.text}")
    if resp.ok:
        data = resp.json()  # Parse JSON response

# Use the client for connection reuse
from floodr import Client
client = Client(max_connections=2048)
responses = await client.request(requests)

# Control concurrency for large batches
responses = await request(requests, max_concurrent=100)
```

### Request Model

The `Request` model supports the following fields:
- `url` (required): The URL to request (validated as proper URL)
- `method`: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS) - defaults to GET
- `headers`: Dictionary of HTTP headers
- `params`: URL query parameters (dict or dict with list values for multiple params)
- `json`: JSON body data (automatically serialized)
- `data`: Form data or raw body (string, bytes, or dict)
- `timeout`: Request timeout in seconds

### Response Model

The `Response` model provides:
- `status_code`: HTTP status code
- `headers`: Response headers as dict
- `content`: Raw response body as bytes
- `text`: Response body as string (property)
- `ok`: True if status is 2xx (property)
- `json()`: Parse response as JSON
- `elapsed`: Time taken for request in seconds
- `url`: Final URL after redirects
- `error`: Error message if request failed (network errors, timeouts, etc.)
- `raise_for_status()`: Raise exception for errors

### Error Handling

floodr provides comprehensive error handling without interrupting batch processing:

```python
from floodr import Request, request

requests = [
    Request(url="https://httpbin.org/status/200"),  # Success
    Request(url="https://httpbin.org/status/404"),  # HTTP error
    Request(url="https://httpbin.org/status/500"),  # Server error
    Request(url="https://invalid-domain.com", timeout=2.0),  # Network error
]

responses = await request(requests)

for req, resp in zip(requests, responses):
    if resp.error:
        # Network error (DNS, connection, timeout)
        print(f"Request failed: {resp.error}")
    elif not resp.ok:
        # HTTP error (4xx, 5xx)
        print(f"HTTP {resp.status_code} error for {resp.url}")
    else:
        # Success
        print(f"Success: {resp.status_code}")

# Or use raise_for_status() for exception-based handling
for resp in responses:
    try:
        resp.raise_for_status()
        # Process successful response
        data = resp.json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

#### Error Types

1. **Network Errors**: Connection failures, DNS resolution, timeouts
   - `status_code`: 0
   - `error`: Contains error message
   - `ok`: False

2. **HTTP Errors**: 4xx and 5xx responses
   - `status_code`: The actual HTTP status
   - `error`: None (valid HTTP response)
   - `ok`: False

3. **Validation Errors**: Invalid URLs, methods, or data
   - Raised immediately when creating Request objects
   - Standard Python exceptions (ValidationError)

### Concurrency Control

The `max_concurrent` parameter allows you to control the number of simultaneous requests:

- **None (default)**: Automatic concurrency based on batch size
  - For ≤100 requests: All requests run concurrently
  - For >100 requests: Limits to `batch_size / 10` (between 100-500)
- **Custom value**: Set a specific limit for concurrent requests

This is particularly useful for:
- Avoiding overwhelming target servers
- Managing memory usage for very large batches
- Complying with rate limits
- Optimizing performance based on network conditions

Example:
```python
# Fetch many URLs with controlled concurrency
requests = [Request(url=f"https://api.example.com/item/{i}") for i in range(1000)]

# Automatic concurrency (would use ~100 concurrent requests)
responses = await request(requests)

# Limited concurrency (gentler on the server)
responses = await request(requests, max_concurrent=50)

# Using client
client = Client()
responses = await client.request(requests, max_concurrent=20)
```

### Connection Pool Warming

When you know you'll be making many concurrent requests to a specific domain, you can pre-warm the connection pool to reduce latency:

```python
import floodr

# Pre-establish 100 connections to the domain
await floodr.warmup("https://api.example.com", num_connections=100)

# Now make your actual requests - they'll reuse the warmed connections
requests = [Request(url=f"https://api.example.com/item/{i}") for i in range(100)]
responses = await request(requests)  # Much lower latency!
```

#### Why Warm Connections?

When making HTTP requests, establishing new connections involves:
1. DNS resolution
2. TCP handshake
3. TLS negotiation (for HTTPS)

This can add 50-200ms per connection. By pre-warming the pool, subsequent requests can reuse existing connections, significantly reducing latency.

#### Advanced Warming

For more control, use `warmup_advanced`:

```python
# Warm specific endpoints with detailed results
results = await floodr.warmup_advanced(
    base_url="https://api.example.com",
    paths=["/health", "/api/v1/status", "/api/v1/users"],
    num_connections=50,
    method="HEAD"  # Use HEAD for minimal data transfer
)

# Check warmup results
for result in results:
    print(f"{result['url']}: {result['status']} in {result['elapsed']:.3f}s")
```

#### Using with Client

The `Client` class also supports warming:

```python
client = Client(max_connections=1000)

# Warm the client's connection pool
await client.warmup("https://api.example.com", num_connections=100)

# Use the warmed client
responses = await client.request(requests)
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Warm before bulk requests**: If you're about to make 100+ requests to a domain, warm with 10-20% of that number
2. **Use HEAD requests**: The default HEAD method minimizes data transfer during warming
3. **Consider server limits**: Don't warm more connections than the server can handle
4. **Reuse warmed pools**: The global client maintains connections for 5 minutes

## Performance

floodr is designed for high-performance parallel requests:

- **6-10x faster** than pure Python solutions like aiohttp for parallel requests
- **Automatic concurrency management** prevents overwhelming servers
- **Memory efficient** with streaming responses
- **Connection pooling** for reduced latency
