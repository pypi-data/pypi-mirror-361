           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

**Optical Character Recognition made seamless & accessible to anyone, powered by PyTorch**

What you can expect from this repository:

- efficient ways to parse textual information (localize and identify each word) from your documents
- guidance on how to integrate this in your current architecture

![OCR_example](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/raw/main/docs/images/ocr.png)

## Quick Tour

### Getting your pretrained model

End-to-End OCR is achieved in docTR using a two-stage approach: text detection (localizing words), then text recognition (identify all characters in the word).
As such, you can select the architecture used for [text detection](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/latest/modules/models.html#doctr-models-detection), and the one for [text recognition](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/latest//modules/models.html#doctr-models-recognition) from the list of available implementations.

```python
from doctr.models import ocr_predictor

model = ocr_predictor(det_arch='db_resnet50', reco_arch='crnn_vgg16_bn', pretrained=True)
```

### Reading files

Documents can be interpreted from PDF or images:

```python
from doctr.io import DocumentFile
# PDF
pdf_doc = DocumentFile.from_pdf("path/to/your/doc.pdf")
# Image
single_img_doc = DocumentFile.from_images("path/to/your/img.jpg")
# Webpage (requires `weasyprint` to be installed)
webpage_doc = DocumentFile.from_url("https://www.yoursite.com")
# Multiple page images
multi_img_doc = DocumentFile.from_images(["path/to/page1.jpg", "path/to/page2.jpg"])
```

### Putting it together

Let's use the default pretrained model for an example:

```python
from doctr.io import DocumentFile
from doctr.models import ocr_predictor

model = ocr_predictor(pretrained=True)
# PDF
doc = DocumentFile.from_pdf("path/to/your/doc.pdf")
# Analyze
result = model(doc)
```

### Dealing with rotated documents

Should you use docTR on documents that include rotated pages, or pages with multiple box orientations,
you have multiple options to handle it:

- If you only use straight document pages with straight words (horizontal, same reading direction),
consider passing `assume_straight_boxes=True` to the ocr_predictor. It will directly fit straight boxes
on your page and return straight boxes, which makes it the fastest option.

- If you want the predictor to output straight boxes (no matter the orientation of your pages, the final localizations
will be converted to straight boxes), you need to pass `export_as_straight_boxes=True` in the predictor. Otherwise, if `assume_straight_pages=False`, it will return rotated bounding boxes (potentially with an angle of 0°).

If both options are set to False, the predictor will always fit and return rotated boxes.

To interpret your model's predictions, you can visualize them interactively as follows:

```python
# Display the result (requires matplotlib & mplcursors to be installed)
result.show()
```

![Visualization sample](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/raw/main/docs/images/doctr_example_script.gif)

Or even rebuild the original document from its predictions:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

synthetic_pages = result.synthesize()
plt.imshow(synthetic_pages[0]); plt.axis('off'); plt.show()
```

![Synthesis sample](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/raw/main/docs/images/synthesized_sample.png)

The `ocr_predictor` returns a `Document` object with a nested structure (with `Page`, `Block`, `Line`, `Word`, `Artefact`).
To get a better understanding of our document model, check our [documentation](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/modules/io.html#document-structure):

You can also export them as a nested dict, more appropriate for JSON format:

```python
json_output = result.export()
```

### Use the KIE predictor

The KIE predictor is a more flexible predictor compared to OCR as your detection model can detect multiple classes in a document. For example, you can have a detection model to detect just dates and addresses in a document.

The KIE predictor makes it possible to use detector with multiple classes with a recognition model and to have the whole pipeline already setup for you.

```python
from doctr.io import DocumentFile
from doctr.models import kie_predictor

# Model
model = kie_predictor(det_arch='db_resnet50', reco_arch='crnn_vgg16_bn', pretrained=True)
# PDF
doc = DocumentFile.from_pdf("path/to/your/doc.pdf")
# Analyze
result = model(doc)

predictions = result.pages[0].predictions
for class_name in predictions.keys():
    list_predictions = predictions[class_name]
    for prediction in list_predictions:
        print(f"Prediction for {class_name}: {prediction}")
```

The KIE predictor results per page are in a dictionary format with each key representing a class name and it's value are the predictions for that class.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Python 3.10 (or higher) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) are required to install docTR.

### Latest release

You can then install the latest release of the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/python-doctr/) as follows:

```shell
pip install python-doctr
```

We try to keep extra dependencies to a minimum. You can install specific builds as follows:

```shell
# standard build
pip install python-doctr
# optional dependencies for visualization, html, and contrib modules can be installed as follows:
pip install "python-doctr[viz,html,contrib]"
```

### Developer mode

Alternatively, you can install it from source, which will require you to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
First clone the project repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mindee/doctr.git
pip install -e doctr/.
```

Again, if you prefer to avoid the risk of missing dependencies, you can install the build:

```shell
pip install -e doctr/.
```

## More goodies

### Documentation

The full package documentation is available [here](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/) for detailed specifications.

### Demo app

A minimal demo app is provided for you to play with our end-to-end OCR models!

![Demo app](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/raw/main/docs/images/demo_update.png)

#### Live demo

Courtesy of :hugs: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) :hugs:, docTR has now a fully deployed version available on [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)!
Check it out [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mindee/doctr)

#### Running it locally

If you prefer to use it locally, there is an extra dependency ([Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)) that is required.

```shell
pip install -r demo/pt-requirements.txt
```

Then run your app in your default browser with:

```shell
streamlit run demo/app.py
```

### Docker container

We offer Docker container support for easy testing and deployment. [Here are the available docker tags.](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/pkgs/container/doctr).

#### Using GPU with docTR Docker Images

The docTR Docker images are GPU-ready and based on CUDA `12.2`. Make sure your host is **at least `12.2`**, otherwise Torch won't be able to initialize the GPU.
Please ensure that Docker is configured to use your GPU.

To verify and configure GPU support for Docker, please follow the instructions provided in the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

Once Docker is configured to use GPUs, you can run docTR Docker containers with GPU support:

```shell
docker run -it --gpus all ghcr.io/mindee/doctr:torch-py3.9.18-2024-10 bash
```

#### Available Tags

The Docker images for docTR follow a specific tag nomenclature: `<deps>-py<python_version>-<doctr_version|YYYY-MM>`. Here's a breakdown of the tag structure:

- `<deps>`: `torch`, `torch-viz-html-contrib`.
- `<python_version>`: `3.9.18`, `3.10.13` or `3.11.8`.
- `<doctr_version>`: a tag >= `v0.11.0`
- `<YYYY-MM>`: e.g. `2014-10`

Here are examples of different image tags:

| Tag                        | Description                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `torch-viz-html-contrib-py3.11.8-2024-10`       | Torch with extra dependencies version `3.11.8` from latest commit on `main` in `2024-10`. |
| `torch-py3.11.8-2024-10`| PyTorch version `3.11.8` from latest commit on `main` in `2024-10`. |

#### Building Docker Images Locally

You can also build docTR Docker images locally on your computer.

```shell
docker build -t doctr .
```

You can specify custom Python versions and docTR versions using build arguments. For example, to build a docTR image with PyTorch, Python version `3.9.10`, and docTR version `v0.7.0`, run the following command:

```shell
docker build -t doctr --build-arg FRAMEWORK=torch --build-arg PYTHON_VERSION=3.9.10 --build-arg DOCTR_VERSION=v0.7.0 .
```

### Example script

An example script is provided for a simple documentation analysis of a PDF or image file:

```shell
python scripts/analyze.py path/to/your/doc.pdf
```

All script arguments can be checked using `python scripts/analyze.py --help`

### Minimal API integration

Looking to integrate docTR into your API? Here is a template to get you started with a fully working API using the wonderful [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) framework.

#### Deploy your API locally

Specific dependencies are required to run the API template, which you can install as follows:

```shell
cd api/
pip install poetry
make lock
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now run your API locally:

```shell
uvicorn --reload --workers 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port=8002 --app-dir api/ app.main:app
```

Alternatively, you can run the same server on a docker container if you prefer using:

```shell
PORT=8002 docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### What you have deployed

Your API should now be running locally on your port 8002. Access your automatically-built documentation at [http://localhost:8002/redoc](http://localhost:8002/redoc) and enjoy your three functional routes ("/detection", "/recognition", "/ocr", "/kie"). Here is an example with Python to send a request to the OCR route:

```python
import requests

params = {"det_arch": "db_resnet50", "reco_arch": "crnn_vgg16_bn"}

with open('/path/to/your/doc.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    files = [  # application/pdf, image/jpeg, image/png supported
        ("files", ("doc.jpg", f.read(), "image/jpeg")),
    ]
print(requests.post("http://localhost:8080/ocr", params=params, files=files).json())
```
