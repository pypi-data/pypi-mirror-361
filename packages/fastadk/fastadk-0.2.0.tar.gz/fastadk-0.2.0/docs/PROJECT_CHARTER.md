# FastADK Project Charter

## Project Vision

FastADK is an open-source framework that dramatically improves developer experience when building AI agents with Google ADK. Following the proven pattern of FastAPI and FastMCP, FastADK provides high-level abstractions, declarative APIs, and developer-friendly tooling while leveraging the full power of the underlying platform.

## Mission Statement

**"Make AI agent development as simple and productive as web API development"**

Transform agent development from manual ADK wiring to declarative Python classes with `@Agent` and `@tool` decorators, automatic HTTP serving, pluggable memory backends, and production-ready tooling.

## Core Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)

### Objective 1: Eliminate Developer Friction

- **KR1**: Reduce agent setup from 50+ lines of code to <10 lines of code
- **KR2**: Achieve <3 minutes from install to running agent
- **KR3**: 85% less boilerplate code compared to raw Google ADK

### Objective 2: Build Thriving Developer Community

- **KR1**: >100 active contributors within 6 months
- **KR2**: >1000 GitHub stars within 3 months of v1.0 launch
- **KR3**: >70% developer retention rate after 30 days

### Objective 3: Establish Production-Ready Platform

- **KR1**: >50 documented production deployments
- **KR2**: 99.9% uptime for managed cloud services
- **KR3**: Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Objective 4: Create Sustainable Ecosystem

- **KR1**: >50 verified plugins within 12 months
- **KR2**: >10 enterprise customers
- **KR3**: Sustainable revenue from cloud platform and services

## Success Metrics

### Technical Performance

- API Response Time: 95th percentile <500ms
- Memory Efficiency: <80MB baseline memory usage
- Performance Improvement: 40% faster than raw ADK implementations
- Test Coverage: >90% with comprehensive integration tests

### Adoption Metrics

- PyPI Downloads: >25K monthly downloads by month 6
- Enterprise Adoption: >10 companies with enterprise licenses
- Academic Adoption: Used in >5 university courses
- Community Health: >90% satisfaction score in developer surveys

## Strategic Positioning

**"FastAPI for AI Agents"** - The obvious choice for developers building intelligent applications.

### Competitive Advantages

1. **First-Mover Advantage**: First high-level framework for Google ADK
2. **Enterprise Ready**: Built-in security, compliance, and scalability
3. **Ecosystem Play**: Plugin marketplace and community-driven development
4. **Multi-Backend Support**: Reduces vendor lock-in with provider abstraction
5. **Developer Experience**: Interactive playground, tutorials, and comprehensive tooling

## Project Governance

### Decision Making
