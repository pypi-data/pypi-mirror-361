# Welcome to optpricing

optpricing is a Python library for pricing and calibrating financial derivatives.

It features a rich CLI, as well as an interactive dashboard;

```bash
optpricing dashboard
```

This will open a Streamlit application in your browser where you can perform calibrations, price options, and visualize results without writing any code.
