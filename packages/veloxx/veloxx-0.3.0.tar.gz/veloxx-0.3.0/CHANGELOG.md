# Changelog

## 0.2.4 - 2025-07-09

### Added

- Implemented missing functionalities in Python bindings (DataFrame I/O, advanced filtering, joining, grouping, column creation, descriptive statistics, data appending, apply methods).
- Implemented missing functionalities in JavaScript/Wasm bindings (DataFrame I/O, advanced filtering, joining, grouping, column creation, descriptive statistics, data appending, apply methods).
- Added comprehensive tests for newly implemented Python and JavaScript/Wasm functionalities.

### Changed

- Updated version to `0.2.4` across `Cargo.toml`, `pkg/package.json`, and all relevant documentation.
- Organized test files into `tests/python/` and updated `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Fixed

- Resolved Wasm test failures by updating import paths and mocking strategy.
- Addressed all Clippy warnings and formatted Rust code.

### Removed

- Redundant Wasm bindings file (`bindings/wasm/mod.rs`).
- Temporary Python example scripts (`temp_inspect_veloxx.py`, `temp_inspect_veloxx_lib.py`).
- `ISSUES.md` (all issues addressed).

  - Optimized join, filter, sort, and aggregation logic.
  - Faster unique value extraction and null interpolation.
  - Type-specific apply methods for Series.
  - More efficient CSV/JSON ingestion and type inference.
- All benchmarks show significant speedups (see README and benchmarks).

## 0.2.0 - 2025-07-02

### Added
