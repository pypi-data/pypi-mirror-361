## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added
- **Dual API Support**: Synchronous and asynchronous APIs for all major methods
  - `agent.chat()` - Synchronous chat (no async/await needed\!)
  - `agent.achat()` - Asynchronous chat
  - `agent.stream_chat()` - Synchronous streaming
  - `agent.astream_chat()` - Asynchronous streaming
  - Similar dual APIs for `add_tool`, `remove_tool`, `clear_memory`
- Comprehensive documentation for the dual API feature
- New examples demonstrating synchronous usage
- Test suite for both sync and async APIs

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Async methods now have 'a' prefix (e.g., `chat` â†’ `achat`)
  - Migration is simple: just add 'a' prefix to async method calls
- Improved developer experience with zero-friction synchronous API
- Updated all documentation and examples to showcase sync-first approach

### Fixed
- Better error handling for synchronous method calls
- Improved initialization flow for sync usage
