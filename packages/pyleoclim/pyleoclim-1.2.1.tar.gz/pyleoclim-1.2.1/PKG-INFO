**Python Package for the Analysis of Paleoclimate Data**

[Paleoclimate](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/what-paleoclimatology) data, whether from observations or model simulations, offer unique challenges to the analyst, as they usually come in the form of timeseries with missing values and age uncertainties, which trip up off-the-shelf methods.
Pyleoclim is a Python package primarily geared towards the analysis and visualization of such timeseries. The package includes several low-level methods to deal with these issues under the hood, leaving paleoscientists to interact with intuitive, high-level analysis and plotting methods that support publication-quality scientific workflows.

There are many entry points to Pyleoclim, thanks to its underlying [data structures](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/api.html). Low-level modules work on [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) arrays or [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) dataframes.

We've worked hard to make Pyleoclim accessible to a wide variety of users, from establisher researchers to high-school students, and from seasoned Pythonistas to first-time programmers. A progressive introduction to the package is available at [PyleoTutorials](http://linked.earth/PyleoTutorials/). Examples of scientific use are given [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022PA004509).  A growing collection of research-grade workflows using Pyleoclim and the LinkedEarth research ecosystem are available as Jupyter notebooks on [paleoBooks](http://linked.earth/PaleoBooks/), with video tutorials on the LinkedEarth [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJaQBFMK2-Q&list=PL93NbaRnKAuF4WpIQf-4y_U4lo-GqcrcW). Pyleoclim is part of the broader Python ecosystem of [Computational Tools for Climate Science](https://neuromatch.io/computational-tools-for-climate-science-course/).  Python novices are encouraged to follow these [self-paced tutorials](http://linked.earth/LeapFROGS) before trying Pyleoclim.

Science-based training materials are also available from the [paleoHackathon repository](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/paleoHackathon). We also run live training workshops every so often. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Linked_Earth), or join our [Discourse Forum](https://discourse.linked.earth) for more information.
