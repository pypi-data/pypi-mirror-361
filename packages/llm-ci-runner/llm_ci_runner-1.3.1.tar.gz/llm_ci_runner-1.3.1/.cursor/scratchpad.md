*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

# Mode: AGENT âš¡

Current Task: Implement automated release notes generation using our own llm-ci-runner tool
Understanding: 
- Current manual release workflow exists in .github/workflows/release.yml
- User wants to use our tool to generate release notes from commit history between tags
- Need to create a template-based approach with placeholders for dynamic fields
- Must restrict access to maintainers only due to LLM API costs
- Should integrate seamlessly with existing release pipeline
- Manual input becomes template variable, not replacement
- Skip empty sections entirely (no "no * in this release")
- Fix schema required fields to match actual needs
- Place template/schema in examples/05-templates folder

Questions:
1. What is the exact git command sequence to extract commit history between tags?
2. How should we structure the template with placeholders for dynamic content?
3. What schema should we use for the release notes output to ensure consistency?
4. How can we restrict the workflow to only maintainers while keeping it in the repo?
5. Should we use Handlebars or Jinja2 templates for the release notes generation?
6. How do we handle the case where there are no commits between tags?
7. What should be the fallback if LLM generation fails during release?
8. How do we integrate this into the existing release.yml workflow without breaking it?

Confidence: 95% (refinements addressed, ready for implementation)

Next Steps:
1. Create template and schema in examples/05-templates/release-notes/
2. Fix schema required fields to match actual template needs
3. Design template structure with conditional sections and manual input variable
4. Create git command sequence for commit history extraction
5. Plan workflow integration and maintainer access control
6. Test with dry-run mode first
7. Implement the solution with proper error handling and fallbacks

### Summary of Implementation

**Phase 1: Simplified Template Approach** âœ…
- Created `examples/05-templates/release-notes/` directory
- Created `template.hbs` with simple system/user message structure
- Removed complex schema - direct markdown output
- Created `template-vars.yaml` with realistic commit examples
- Created `README.md` with simplified documentation

**Phase 2: Helper Script** âœ…
- Created `scripts/generate-release-notes.py` for git history extraction
- Removed `scripts/process-release-notes.py` (no longer needed)
- Implemented proper error handling and validation
- Tested with real git history successfully

**Phase 3: Release Workflow Integration** âœ…
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` with new `generate-release-notes` job
- Added maintainer access controls via GitHub environment
- Created `.github/environments/release.yml` for protection
- Integrated generated notes with existing release job
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks

**Phase 4: Testing and Documentation** âœ…
- Tested template rendering with LLM successfully
- Updated `examples/README.md` with new release notes example
- Documented complete workflow and usage

### Key Features Implemented

1. **KISS Principle**: Simple system message with clear instructions, direct markdown output
2. **No Schema Complexity**: Direct text output, no structured data processing
3. **Template-Based Approach**: Handlebars template with version variables and commit history
4. **Maintainer Access Control**: GitHub environment protection restricts LLM calls to maintainers only
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallbacks if LLM generation fails
6. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing release workflow
7. **Cost Control**: Single LLM call per release (~$0.01-0.02 cost)
8. **Professional Output**: Generates markdown-formatted release notes with proper sections and standard footer

### Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `examples/05-templates/release-notes/template.hbs`
- `examples/05-templates/release-notes/template-vars.yaml`
- `examples/05-templates/release-notes/README.md`
- `scripts/generate-release-notes.py`
- `.github/environments/release.yml`

**Modified Files:**
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` (added generate-release-notes job)
- `examples/README.md` (added release notes example)
- `llm_ci_runner/io_operations.py` (added direct markdown output support)

### Usage

**Manual Testing:**
```bash
# Generate template variables from git history
uv run python scripts/generate-release-notes.py 1.2.2 "Manual instructions"

# Generate release notes using template
uv run llm-ci-runner \
  --template-file examples/05-templates/release-notes/template.hbs \
  --template-vars template-vars.yaml \
  --output-file release-notes.md
```

**GitHub Actions:**
- Trigger manual release workflow
- Maintainer approval required for LLM calls
- Automated release notes generation
- Direct markdown output in GitHub release

The implementation is complete and ready for production use! ðŸŽ‰
