2.  Under the latest release, find the file for your operating system (e.g., `Ultratypetest-windows.zip`, `Ultratypetest-macos.zip`).
3.  Download and unzip the file.
4.  You will find a single executable file inside (e.g., `ultratypetest.exe`). You can now run the application directly from your terminal!

### For Developers (via `pip`)

If you have Python installed and are comfortable with the command line, you can install the tool using `pip` (or `uv`).

```bash
# Install the package from PyPI
pip install ultratypetest-cli #or
uv pip install ultratypetest-cli

# Now you can run it from anywhere
ultratypetest
```
