# Jupyter Turtle 

This is an implementation of simplified Turtle graphics to support my [Python
for Everyone](https://github.com/mike-matera/python-for-everyone) course.
[Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_\(programming_language\)) was my first
programming language. The purpose of this implementation is to give beginners a
visual experience to help them understand algorithmic reasoning. The module
contains a `Turtle` class implementation with a full API and a simplified API
that I use in class.
