# AveyTense

**AveyTense** is a library written by Aveyzan using Python, which provides especially extensions to inbuilt Python solutions.

## Features

Features are included in [this page](https://aveyzan.xyz/aveytense#documentation).
For code changes see [this Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GC_KAOXML65jNfBZA8GhVViqPnrMoFtbLv_jHvUhBlg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Getting started

To install AveyTense, run the following command:

```
pip install aveytense
```

Ensure you have [`typing_extensions`](https://pypi.org/project/typing_extensions) PyPi project with version 4.10.0 or above, and Python 3.8 or above.

If you think you are out of date, consider checking out [releases section](https://pypi.org/project/aveytense/#history) and running following command:

```py
pip install --upgrade aveytense
```

After installation process, you can import module `aveytense`, which imports AveyTense components into your project.

> **Note**: It is highly recommended to install latest final version of AveyTense. Do not rely on alpha, beta releases, and
> release candidates before their final counterparts are published.

> **Warning**: Support for Python 3.8 just has been initiated in version 0.3.46, so some definitions will be still prone for errors due
> to the backward-compatibility. For code changes to completely support Python 3.8 there will be still need to inspect every definition
> included in the project.

## Bug report

Bug fixes will be issued in future versions of AveyTense. The project isn't intended to be a malware or any subject for hacking others' computers.

If you will use my project for your projects, please enjoy! It will become my duty providing more changes.
