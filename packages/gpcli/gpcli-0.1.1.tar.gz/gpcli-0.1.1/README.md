# gpcli

**gpcli (Git Push CLI)** is a simple CLI tool for instantly running `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, and `git push` with a single command.

---

## 🚀 Usage

From any git repository, simply run:

```bash
gp "your commit message"
```

The tool will:
- Stage all changes (`git add .`)
- Commit with your message
- Push to the current branch

## 💡 Why?

Typing `git add . && git commit -m "" && git push` every time is boring!  
Use `pycmt` for one-shot commits to speed up your workflow.
