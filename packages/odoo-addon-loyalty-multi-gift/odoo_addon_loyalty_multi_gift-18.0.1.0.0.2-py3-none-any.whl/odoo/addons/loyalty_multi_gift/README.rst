This module allows to define multiple reward products on promotions.

Use Cases / Context
===================

For the 'buy_x_get_y' type promotion, the 'Reward_type' field is
restricted to the 'Product' option only and the possibility to select
'Multigift' is disabled. This restriction is implemented because, in
this scenario, the 'reward_type' field becomes 'readonly'.

It is crucial to note that modifying the values displayed in this field
to set different values according to the type of promotion may generate
conflicts with other modules that contribute to the configuration of
this same field. Therefore, it is recommended not to alter these values
directly, as this may affect the consistency and functionality of other
components of the system.

To configure similar promotions, it is suggested to modify another type
of promotion by adapting its rules and rewards according to specific
needs. This provides a more secure and consistent way to manage custom
configurations without compromising the integrity of the system.

Configuration
=============

To configure multiple product rewards:

1. Go to *Sales > Products > Discount & Loyalty* and select or create a
   new one.
2. Choose the criteria of appliance you want to use and the minimum
   quantities, that will be used to calculate the times the rewards can
   be applied.
3. On the *Program Type* field choose *Multi Gift*.
4. You'll see a now the *Gift list* on which you can add the products
   you want to give away and the quantities for each of them.

An example:

   [TABLE]

With a minimum quantity of 3, for every 3 units of products that fulfill
the domain we'd get 3 units of A and 2 of B. So if the valid products
quantities are 11, we'd get 3 of product A and 2 of product B.

Usage
=====

This module is a base to be used by extra modules that use it in sale
orders, PoS orders, etc.
