## Notes


## Todo-List

### Prepare work:

- [ ] Linked this issue in the meta issue for algorithm development
- [ ] Created new branch and PR for this algorithm
- [ ] Input Output datatypes identified
- [ ] Relevant algorithm parameters identified
- [ ] Identified all relevant information
- [ ] Confirmed the info and general implementation plan with the rest of the developer team

### Generate results from original implementation

- [ ] Original algorithm is running locally
- [ ] Example outputs from original algorithms generated and added to the repo

### Implementation of Algorithm

- [ ] Core algorithm implemented
- [ ] Wrapper class implemented
- [ ] Initial peer-code review completed
- [ ] Extensive docstring added to algorithm class (should include references!)
- [ ] General tests added for the wrapper class
- [ ] Unit tests added (in particular to test edge cases)
- [ ] Example created (example should show how to use the algorithm, visualize the algo results and show a comparison the reference data and the results from the original implementation)
- [ ] Regression test for example created
- [ ] Added wrapper class to documentation
- [ ] Final code review completed
- [ ] PR merged and meta issue updated
