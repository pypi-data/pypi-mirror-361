**Flask-Back** is a lightweight Flask extension for managing "back" URLs to help users return to their previous page in a clean and configurable way.

---

## üöÄ Features

* Automatically or manually save back URLs
* Use `{{ back_url }}` in templates
* Fallback to the referrer if no back URL is saved
* Exclude specific endpoints from tracking
* Session-based and lightweight

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install flask-back
```

---

## üß™ Quick Example

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect
from flask_back import Back

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = "supersecret"

back = Back(app, default_url="/", use_referrer=True)

@app.route("/save")
@back.save_url
def save_page():
    return "This page is now saved as the back URL."

@app.route("/go-back")
def go_back():
    return redirect(back.get_url())

@app.route("/excluded")
@back.exclude
def excluded_page():
    return "This page won't be tracked as a back URL."
```

In templates:

```jinja2
<a href="{{ back_url }}">Go Back</a>
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can pass these options when initializing:

```python
Back(app,
     default_url="/fallback",     # Where to go if nothing is saved
     use_referrer=True,           # Use Referer header as fallback
     excluded_endpoints=["static"]  # List of endpoints to skip
)
```
