#72 : Digesting two scoops of Django
====================================

My notes while reading 
`Two scoops of Django <https://django.2scoops.org/>`_.
Warning: 
This document is work in progress and may change frequently during the coming weeks.

This book is probably the first book about software which I really *loved* to read.
I work mostly alone, while Danny and Audrey obviously communicate 
a lot with other programmers.
My soul was thirsting for 
impulses from competent Python programmers 
about how to make Lino better.
Their book satisfies this need.


Ideas for Lino
--------------

The following plans are directly inspired by the book:

- Rename "Company" to "Organisation":
  more to type but less to explain.

- replace MTI (Multi-Table Inheritance) by OneToOne fields 
  (which requires :doc:`73`)
  
- rename 'apps' to 'projects', 'modlib' to 'lib' or 'apps'

- replace all local settings with versioned settings files.

- split Lino as explained in :doc:`/2013/0203`.
  


Less urgent
-----------

- use relative imports
- use pgsql for development
- use pip, virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper

Questions
---------

- You recommend github and bitbucket, why not Google code?
