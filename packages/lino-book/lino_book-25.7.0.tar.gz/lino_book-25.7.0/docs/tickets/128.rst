#128 [closed] : Http404 "There's no app_label u'lino' here"
===========================================================

For example if user calls :menuselection:`Explorer --> System --> User
levels`.

This bug has been introduced on :blogref:`20140920` (by the fact that
the objects stored in :attr:`rt.models` are no longer
:class:`AttrDict <atelier.utils.AttrDict>` instances but the
:xfile:`models.py` modules themselves):

Since the `lino` app has no :xfile:`models.py` module, it doesn't get
an entry in :attr:`rt.models`.

In fact bug is a confirmation that the change made Lino more
beautiful!  Because the arbitrary `app_label` ("lino") on these
choicelists was an ugliness, and now we are going to solve it by
moving all those choicelists to their right place.

TODO:

- Move definition of 

  - :class:`dd.Genders` from :mod:`lino.core.choicelists` to
  - :class:`dd.PeriodEvents` from :mod:`lino.mixins.periods` to 

- Move the choicelists defined in :mod:`lino.core.perms` to
  :mod:`lino.modlib.users`. (TODO: what happens with apps that don't
  have any user management? For example :ref:`lino.tutorial.polls`.)
