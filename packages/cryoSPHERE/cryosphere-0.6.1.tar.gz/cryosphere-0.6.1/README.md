# cryoSPHERE: Single-particle heterogeneous reconstruction from cryo EM

CryoSPHERE is a structural heterogeneous reconstruction software of cryoEM data. It requires an estimate of the CTF and poses of each image. This can be obtained using other softwares.
CryoSPHERE works with two yaml files: one `parameters.yaml` describing the hyperparameters used to train cryoSPHERE and a `image.yaml` file, describing the images in the dataset. You can find a commented example of these files in the repository.  

The file `parameters.yaml` describes how to fit a single segmentation for the entire protein.
The file `parameters_two_segmentation.yaml` describes how you can segment chain A and chain C (for example) only, and how to create a custom starting segmentation and define a custom prior on the segmentation. Note that if these custom starting segmentation and prior are not defined, the values of the segmentation are taken so that it is uniform. See the class Segmentation in the file segmentation.py.

Since cryoSPHERE version 0.5.8, multi-gpu runs have been enabled for both training and analyzing the results, see below. By default, cryoSPHERE will use all the available GPUs. If you want to use only a subset of them, you can specify them by typing:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=gpu_id_1, gpu_id_2, ..., gpu_id_n
``` 
right before the cryoSPHERE command you want to use, where gpu_id_1, ... gpu_id_n must be replaced by the integers denoting the devices you want cryoSPHERE to see.
## Installation

CryoSPHERE is available as a python package named `cryosphere`. Create a conda environment and activate it:
```
conda create -n cryosphere python==3.9.20
conda activate cryosphere
```
Install PyTorch on your system, enabling GPU usage. You can find the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

Finally, you can install cryoSPHERE
```
pip install cryosphere
```

## A minimal reproducible example

We have published a minimal reproducible example on zenodo with results for verifying that your installation works correctly. You can find it at this [zenodo link](https://zenodo.org/records/15794610).

## A word about `wandb`

Weights and Biases (wandb) is an AI development platform enabling easy monitoring of the training of deep learning methods. The `cryosphere` package comes with the `wandb` package. You have two option:

1/ Create a wandb account and set your API key, whether by exporting an environment variable or login in at the start of cryoSPHERE, as explained [here](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart/). If you login at the start of cryoSPHERE, wandb creates a login file containing your API key and you will not need to do it for the subsequent runs. 
If you choose to login in wandb instead of setting and environment variable, you can also do it before your first cryoSPHERE run, by opening the python interpreter inside your cryosphere conda environment, and type:
```
ìmport wandb
wandb.login()
```
You will be prompted to enter your API key. 

2/ If you do not want to use wandb and are happy with the run.log file created in the cryoSPHERE folder that cryoSPHERE creates at the beginning of the run, you just change the `wandb: True` to `wandb: False` in the yaml file containing the paramters of cryoSPHERE.

## Training
### Preliminary: consensus reconstruction.
Before running cryoSPHERE on a dataset you need  to run a homogeneous reconstruction software such as RELION or cryoSparc. This should yield a star file containing the poses of each image, the CTF and information about the images as well as one or several mrcs file(s) containing the actual images. You should also obtain one or several mrc files corresponding to consensus reconstruction(s). For this tutorial, we assume your images are in a file called `particles.mrcs` and after a consensus reconstruction, you obain a star file named `particles.star` and a consensus reconstruction file called `consensus_map.mrc`. This naming is not mandatory, your files can have arbitrary names as long as the extension is correct. CryoSPHERE would also work with data preprocessed by cryoSparc. In that case you can directly use the `particles.cs` file.

This step is important to obtain an estimation of the CTF and the pose of each image. 

### First step: centering the structure
Fit a good atomic structure of the protein of interest into the volume obtained in the prelimiary step (`consensus_map.mrc`), using e.g ChimeraX. Save this structure in pdb format: `fitted_structure.pdb`. You can now use cryoSPHERE's command line tools to center the structure and volume:
```
cryosphere_center_origin --pdb_file_path fitted_structure.pdb --mrc_file_path consensus_map.mrc
```
This yields a pdb file `fitted_structure_centered.pdb` of the centered structure and a mrc file `consensus_map_centered.mrc` of the centered consensus volume.

### First step bis (optional)
Since the datasets are usually very noisy, it might be helpful to apply a low pass filter to the images. To determine the bandwith cutoff, first turn the centered structure into a volume, using the same GMM representation of the protein used during the training of cryoSPHERE:
```
cryosphere_structure_to_volume --image_yaml /path/to/image.yaml --structure_path/path/to/fitted_structure_centered.pdb --output_path /path/to/fitted_structure_centered_volume.mrc
```
You can now compute the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) between `fitted_structure_centered_volume.mrc` and `consensus_map_centered.mrc` using available softwares: e.g the e2proc3d command of EMAN2 or online [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/validation/fsc/). 
Next, find the frequency `cutoff_freq` for which the FSC is equal to 0.5, and set `lp_bandwidth: 1/cutoff_freq` in the `parameters.yaml`. This means that the in the images, the frequencies such that `freq > 1/lp_bandwidth` are set to 0.

### Second step

The second step is to run cryoSPHERE. To run it, you need  two yaml files: a `parameters.yaml` file, defining all the parameters of the training run and a `image.yaml` file, containing informations about the images. You need to set the `folder_experiment` entry of the paramters.yaml to the path of the folder containing your data. You also need to change the `base_structure` entry to `fitted_structure_centered.pdb`. You can then run cryosphere using the command line tool:
```
cryosphere_train --experiment_yaml /path/to/parameters.yaml
```

This command creates a folder named `cryoSPHERE` which contains the PyTorch models `ckpt_{n_epoch}.pt` and the segmentations `seg_{n_epoch}.pt`, one at the end of each epoch. It also copies the `parameters.yaml` and `image.yaml` files in this directory and creates a `run.log` to log training data.

You can customize the `parameters.yaml` file, especially the segmentation. You can choose between a global segmentation of the protein and a local one.

The global segmentation is demonstrated in `parameters.yaml` and only requires you to set the number of segments and the entry `all_protein: True`. Be careful that this segmentation considers the entire protein as a single chain, where the residues are ordered as in the pdb file of the base structure you are using.

The local segmentation allows you to specify what part of the protein you want to segment, and what part of the protein you want to fix. If your protein has chains e.g A, B, C and D, you can segment only the residues 0 to 50 of chain A and the residues 130 to 240 of chain C. The remaining residues of the protein will not move. These two segmentations are "separate". See `parameters_two_segmentation.yaml`.


Finally, if you do not specify a starting segmentation, the means of the Gaussian modes of the segmentation are taken evenly along the residues, the standard deviations are all equal to `N_residues/N_segments`and the mean of the porportions are set to 0.
The same is true for the prior distribution on the segmentation. You can specify a starting segmentation or a prior, or both, or none, for each part you are segmenting. See `parameters_two_segmentation.yaml` for an example.
## Analysis

Once cryoSPHERE has been trained, you can get the latent variables corresponding to the images and generate a PCA analysis of the latent space, with latent traversal of first principal components:
```
cryosphere_analyze --experiment_yaml /path/to/parameters.yaml --model /path/to/model.pt --segmenter /path/to/segmenter.pt --output_path /path/to/outpout_folder --no-generate_structures
```
where `model.pt` is the saved torch model you want to analyze, `segmenter.pt` is the corresponding segmentation  and output_folder is the folder where you want to save the results of the analysis.
This will create the following directory structure:
```
analysis
   |	z.npy
   |	pc0
	   |   structure_z_1.pdb
	   .
	   .
	   .
	   |   structure_z_10.pdb
           |    pca.png
   
   |	pc1
	   |   structure_z_1.pdb
	   .
	   .
           .
```
 If you want to generate all structures (one for each image), you can set `--generate_structures` instead. This will skip the PCA step. The file `z.npy` contains the latent variable associated to each image (in the same order as the images in the star file), the `.pdb` files are the structures sampled along the principal component (from lowest to highest values along that PC) and the `.png` files are images of the PCA decompositions.

It is also possible to get the structures corresponding to specific images. Save the latent variables corresponding to the images of interest into a `z_interest.npy`. You can then run:
```
cryosphere_analyze --experiment_yaml /path/to/parameters.yaml --model /path/to/model.pt --output_path /path/to/outpout_folder --z /path/to/z_interest.npy --segmenter /path/to/segmenter.pt --generate_structures
``` 
Setting the `--z /path/to/z_interest.npy` argument will directly decode the latent variables in `z_interest.npy` into structures.
