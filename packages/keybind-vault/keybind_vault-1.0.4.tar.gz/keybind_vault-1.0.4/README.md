## Getting Started

### For Contributors / Developers

If you want to clone the repo, modify code, and work on the project locally:

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thompsonrm/Keybind-Vault.git
cd Keybind-Vault
```

#### 2. Set up a virtual environment

```bash
# With Python's built-in venv
python -m venv .venv

# Or with uv
uv venv

# Activate the environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Or on Unix/macOS
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies and set up in editable mode

```bash
# Sync dependencies (using uv)
uv sync

# Install package in editable mode
uv pip install -e .

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.13+
- [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) — modern TUI framework for Python
- [Uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.
- [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.
- SQLite (via `sqlite3` module)

## Issues
- Opening the search modal before other screen modals will result in visual issues.
