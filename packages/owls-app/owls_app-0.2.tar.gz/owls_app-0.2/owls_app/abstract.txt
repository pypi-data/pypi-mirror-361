We present initial results from a planned 10 year survey of Ca II H \& K
emission, using observations made with the ARC 3.5m Telescope at Apache
Point Observatory.  The primary goal of the survey is to investigate
activity cycles in low mass stars.  The sample includes stars chosen from
the legacy Mount Wilson survey carried out by Olin Wilson more than 50 years ago,
together with newly identified planet-host stars and a select sample of early-mid M dwarfs.
This paper presents the first four years of data, comprising 1040 observations
of 271 stars, with a specific focus on K and M stars.  We identify a
subsample of 153 stars for continuing observations over the full
10 year survey. Early results indicate that our data are
consistent with the MWO cycle periods over a time span of more than 50
years; that there is a bifurcation in activity in the late K range with
separate populations of low and high activity stars at lower masses; and
that M dwarf planet hosts tend to be mainly found in the population of low
activity stars, even in the unbiased (by activity) TESS sample,
potentially indicating a link between activity and planet formation.
We have also found indications of possible cyclic variability in some
of the lower mass stars in the sample.  Our ultimate goal is
to link the activity cycle and rotation periods in a robust sample of
stars spanning FGKM spectral types and to investigate the implications
for the underlying magnetic dynamo.
