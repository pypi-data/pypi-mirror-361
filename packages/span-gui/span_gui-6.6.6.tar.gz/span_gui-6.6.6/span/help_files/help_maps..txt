SPAN: SPectral ANalysis software V6.6

****Plot maps window****

This window provides a simple and efficient way to visualise 2D maps from spectra processed from datacubes and fully processed with SPAN using the 'DataCube extraction' routine and any Spectral analysis task. 
You need two files in order to plot the maps:

1) The RUN_NAME_table.fits generated during the extraction process of the 'DataCube extraction' routine, which contains the information of the Voronoi (or manual) spectral bins generated;
2) The RUN_NAME_*.dat file(s) generated by any spectral analysis routine on the same sample of 1D extracted spectra. 

Once the required files are browsed (they can be anywhere on your computer), just click 'Load files' and in the listbox below will appear the quantities available to plot, taken from the ASCII .dat file loaded. You can then plot any of these quantities and display an interactive map on a Matplotlib window by clicking 'Plot Map'. In this window, you can click on the map to display the identifier of the selected spectral bin. 
You can save the current map in high resolution PNG image by clicking the 'Save selected' button, or you can automatically save the maps for all the quantities available by clicking the 'Save all' button. 

You can change the color code of the maps within the 'Colormap' menu.
