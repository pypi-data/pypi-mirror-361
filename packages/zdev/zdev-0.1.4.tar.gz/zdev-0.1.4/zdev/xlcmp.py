    COMPARES
    
    
    Both workbooks are expected to have the same column headers in the first line of the 
    respective 'tab'. Moreover, it is advised to keep the 'allow' flags active, since 
    deactivating these may render unexpected results if the 2nd workbook nevertheless 
    exhibits such modifications.    
    
    Args:
        file 1 / 2 : Filenames of Excel workbooks (*.xlsx) to compare
        tab 
        cols (list of int|str, optional): List of columns that should be used for the row-wise 
            comparison. The elements can be given as either 'int' (1-based) or as 'str' in 
            which case the 1st row in the spreadsheet is expected to contain column headers. 
            Defaults to 'None' (i.e. all columns will be checked).
        mode (str, optional): Mode of comparison for changes w/ options 'first'|'all'. Defaults 
            to 'first' to enable faster processing.
        max_rows 
        allow_inserts (bool, optional): Switch for taking inserted rows into account. Defaults 
            to 'True'. 
        allow_moves (bool, optional): Switch for taking moved rows into account. Defaults to 
            'True'. 
        save_to_file (bool, optional): Swicth to store results to a comparison files w/ all 
            modifications being highlighted appropriately ("_cmp.xlsx").
        verbose (bool, optional): Switch to enable debugging messages. Defaults to 'False'.                   
        
    Returns:
        stat (dict): Statistics on modifications found in the sheet of 'file2' acc. to the 
            categories 'ok' / 'changed' / 'inserted' / 'moved'.
        track_changes (list of 2-tuples): All changes that found in the sheet of 'file2'. The
            format of each item is given by a 2-tuple (see also 'xl_cmp_rows()'):
            (row, row2), [(col1, text, text_changed) [, ..., (colN, text, text_changed)]]
        track_inserts (list): Indices of all rows that have been newly inserted in the sheet
