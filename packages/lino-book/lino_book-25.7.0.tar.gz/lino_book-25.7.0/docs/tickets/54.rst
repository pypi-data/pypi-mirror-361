#54 [closed] : Report Generator
===============================

- New notion of groups and totals. These would be ignored when 
  rendering the table in an editor grid.

- Add user-editable parameters to a Table. 
  Technically similar to the existing 
  :attr:`lino.core.table.AbstractTable.known_values`,
  maybe even replacing them,
  but defined like Django database field instances 
  on the Table (thus not managed by Django)
  and displayed for editing when a Table is rendered.
  
- :attr:`lino.core.table.AbstractTable.show_slave_grid` 
  will be replaced by an attribute `default_format` which can 
  have the existing possibilities "editor grid" and "summary" 
  plus the new possibility "html". 
  This new possibility would render the table as 
  "plain" html and with groups and totals.
