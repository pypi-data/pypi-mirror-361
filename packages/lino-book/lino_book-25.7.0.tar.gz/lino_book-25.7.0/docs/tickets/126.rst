#126 [closed] : Demo Tallinn on September 26
============================================

I got the honour to present Lino at the 
`Vaba Tarkvara PÃ¤ev 2014 <http://www.bcskoolitus.ee/vtp2014>`_,
an information day about Free software in education,
for IT managers and directors of Estonian schools.

- An Estonian online demo of :ref:`voga` at
  http://vtp2014.lino-framework.org/
- Some documents on paper: a flyer to hand out, and a poster to hang
  over my table.

Summary: the day was a pleasant experience for me and a successful
step for Lino towards becoming more known.
