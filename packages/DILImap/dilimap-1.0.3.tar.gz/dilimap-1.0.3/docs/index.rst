Welcome to DILImap
==================

**DILImap** is the largest RNA-seq toxicogenomics library for Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI), built using primary human
hepatocytes. It includes transcriptomic profiles from 300 DILI-relevant compounds across multiple doses, setting a new
benchmark for predicting and understanding DILI mechanisms.

**ToxPredictor**, our machine learning model trained on DILImap, delivers state-of-the-art DILI risk assessments â€”
achieving 88% sensitivity at 100% specificity, outperforming existing methods.

ðŸ’Š Core applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Predict dose-resolved **DILI risk for new compounds**
- Estimate DILI **safety margins to prioritize candidates**
- Define tolerable **dose ranges to inform clinical guidance**
- Reveal predictive **DILI pathways linked to known mechanisms**

ðŸ“š Getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Install DILImap using::

    pip install dilimap
