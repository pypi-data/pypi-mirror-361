Tests
=====

This folder contains the tests for Sciris.

Installation
------------

To install test dependencies, use ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

Usage
-----

Recommended usage is ``./check_coverage`` or ``./run_tests``. You can also use ``pytest`` to run all the tests in the folder. To run tests in parallel using ``pytest-parallel`` (which is faster but less robust than the default ``pytest-xdist``), use ``./run_tests fast``.
