## Features

The `drought_indices_python` package offers a growing suite of essential drought indices:

* **Potential Evapotranspiration (PET):**
    * `calculate_pet_thornthwaite`: Estimates PET using the widely recognized Thornthwaite (1948) method, based on temperature and daylight hours.
* **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI):**
    * `calculate_spi`: Quantifies precipitation deficit or surplus over various timescales, utilizing a calibration period for robust statistical fitting.
* **Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI):**
    * `calculate_spei`: A powerful drought indicator based on the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, aggregated and transformed to a standard normal variate using a defined calibration period.
* **Data Utilities:**
    * Functions for loading, preprocessing, and saving meteorological and hydrological data.

## Installation

You can install `drought_indices_python` directly from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install drought_indices_python
