pycopy.sync("path/to/directory1", "path/to/directory2")
```

To make it also delete files:
```python

pycopy.sync("path/to/directory1", "path/to/directory2", do_delete=True)
```

### Usage as command

pipx install pycopy
```

Then simply execute the command using:
```bash
pycopy "path/to/directory1" "path/to/directory2"
