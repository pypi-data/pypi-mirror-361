## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Calculation Methods

#### Consistency Score
```python
# Based on standard deviation of weekly contributions
variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in weekly_sums) / len(weekly_sums)
std_dev = variance ** 0.5
consistency = max(0, 100 - (std_dev / mean * 100))
```

#### Momentum Score
```python
# Compare recent vs earlier activity
recent_avg = sum(week_sums[-quarter:]) / quarter_size
early_avg = sum(week_sums[:quarter]) / quarter_size
momentum = ((recent_avg - early_avg) / early_avg) * 100
```

#### Burnout Risk
```python
# High activity + long streak = potential burnout
if recent_avg > 20 and current_streak > 30:
    risk = "High"
elif recent_avg > 15 and current_streak > 20:
    risk = "Moderate"
else:
    risk = "Low"
```
