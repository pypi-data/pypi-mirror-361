Implementation from: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bzCH3Yaq8gK0ZByxlcaRaj3pOc2u6zht#scrollTo=ezUlfYJ59jWl
Described in: https://medium.com/deep-learning-for-protein-design/a-comprehensive-guide-to-memory-usage-in-pytorch-b9b7c78031d3

Formula (from above source):

Let m = model memory

Let f = the amount of memory consumed by the forward pass for a batch_size of 1.

Let g = m be the amount of memory for the gradients.

Let d = 1 if training on one GPU and 2 if training on >1 GPU.

Let o = the number of moments stored by the optimizer (probably 0, 1, or 2)

Let b = 0.5 if using mixed precision training, and 1 if using full precision training.

Then for training,

Max memory consumption = m + f*batch_size*b + d*g + o*m
