# `DirectNeuralBiasing`

## Overview

`DirectNeuralBiasing` is a Rust package developed by the Human Electrophysiology Lab at UCL for low-latency, closed-loop neuroscience research. The library is designed to interface with Blackrock Microsystems devices for lab use. It is written in `Rust` with bindings for `Python` and soon `C++`.

## Features

- Real-time signal processing for closed-loop neuroscience experiments.
- Modular structure with filters, detectors, and triggers.
- Python bindings for ease of use.
