=========================
Programming for beginners
=========================

This is a sustainably free autodidactic course for people who have no clue what
software programming in Python actually is but who want to learn. Welcome on
board :-)

The only goal of this course is to get you started. It does not even *try* to be
complete because you will find so many :doc:`other learning resources
</dev/newbies/learning>` once your fire has been lighted.
