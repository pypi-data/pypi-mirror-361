CaelumSys Windows-Specific Tools Plugin

This plugin provides Windows-specific system utilities and administrative tools.
All commands are protected by the @safe_windows decorator, which ensures they
only execute on Windows systems and return an appropriate error message on
other platforms.

Commands provided:
- System Administration:
  * "open task manager" - Launch Windows Task Manager
  * "open device manager" - Open Device Manager console
  * "open control panel" - Launch Windows Control Panel
  
- File System Access:
  * "open file explorer" - Open Windows File Explorer
  
- Security:
  * "lock workstation" - Lock the current user session

Platform Compatibility:
- All commands check platform.system() == "Windows"
- Non-Windows systems receive informative error messages
- Commands use Windows-specific executables and system calls

Safety Features:
- All commands are marked as safe=True (launch system tools)
- Lock workstation provides immediate security without data loss
- No destructive operations or system modifications

Dependencies:
- platform: For OS detection
- subprocess: For launching Windows system utilities

Usage Examples:
    >>> from caelum_sys.core_actions import do
    >>> do("open task manager")  # On Windows
    "üß∞ Task Manager opened."
    
    >>> do("open task manager")  # On Linux/Mac
    "‚ùå This command is only available on Windows."

All launched applications run independently and don't block the command system.

    Decorator to ensure commands only execute on Windows systems.
    
    This decorator wraps Windows-specific functions to check the current

    an informative error message instead of attempting to run Windows-only
    commands that would fail.
