## 🧠 The Problem: The Empty Commit Syndrome

![empty commit](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Tostenn/Commitly/images/vide.jpeg)

You just wrapped up an intense dev session. You proudly run:

```bash
git add .
git commit ""
```

And then… nothing.

The cursor blinks. The quotes are empty. **No idea** what to write.
How do you summarize what you just did? How do you follow commit conventions? Should you mention the ticket? Where? How?

That’s where **Commitly** comes in.

---

# 🚀 What is Commitly?

**Commitly** is a Python library that uses AI to **automatically generate smart commit messages** from your staged Git changes (`git diff --cached`).

No more writer’s block. Commitly gives you **clear, structured, multilingual** messages — even **splits large diffs into logical commits** if needed.

---

## 📦 Installation

Install Commitly via PyPI:

```bash
pip install commitly
```

> Make sure [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed and properly configured on your system.

---

## ⚙️ Main Features

### 🔹 `__init__(file_temp="commit.txt", lang="fr")`

Creates a Commitly instance:

* `file_temp`: Temporary file name to save the commit message.
* `lang`: Output language (`en` or `fr`). Default is French.

---

### 🔹 `add(file: str) -> bool`

Adds a file to the Git staging area.

```python
commitly.add("app/models/user.py")
```

---

### 🔹 `generate_commit_message(...) -> dict | List[dict]`

Generates **one or more commit messages** from the current staged diff.

Parameters:

* `style_commit`, `format_commit`, `recommandation_commit`: Customize commit style and rules.
* `ticket`: Ticket ID to include in the commit.
* `fact` (**bool**): Enables **smart factorization** to split the diff into multiple coherent commits.

> ⚠️ Raises a `DiffEmptyException` if no changes are detected in staging.

---

### 🔹 `save_message_to_file(message: str) -> bool`

Saves the generated commit message to the temporary file.

---

### 🔹 `commit() -> bool`

Performs a Git commit using the saved message from the temporary file and deletes it afterward.

---

### 🔹 `push()`

Pushes your latest commit to the remote repository.

---

### 🔹 `unstage(file: str)`

Removes a file from the Git staging area (`git reset <file>`).

---

### 🔹 `file_stage() -> List[str]`

Returns a list of currently staged files (`git diff --cached --name-only`).

---

### 🔹 `_run_cmd(cmd: str, return_code: bool = False)`

Internal method to execute shell commands.

## 🧪 Full Example

```python
from commitly.commitly import Commitly

commitly = Commitly()

# Stage a file
commitly.add("main.py")

# Generate a message with a ticket
message = commitly.generate_commit_message(ticket="#42")

# Save it and commit
commitly.save_message_to_file(message["commit"])
commitly.commit()
commitly.push()
```

---

## 🧠 Example with **smart factorization**

```python
messages = commitly.generate_commit_message(ticket="#42", fact=True)
for item in messages:
    print(item["commit"], ":", item["files"])
```

Example output:

```json
[
    {
        "commit": "feat[core]: add role management to authentication",
        "files": ["auth/roles.py", "auth/utils.py"]
    },
    {
        "commit": "docs: update setup guide",
        "files": ["docs/setup.md"]
    }
]
```

## 🧩 About the Commit Format

Generated messages follow a conventional structure:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer] ← ticket goes here (#1234)
```

Common types:

* `feat`: a new feature
* `fix`: a bug fix
* `docs`: documentation-only changes
* `refactor`: code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
* `chore`: other routine tasks like config or CI changes
