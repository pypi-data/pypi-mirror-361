System Utilities Plugin

This plugin provides system-level operations like locking the screen,
shutting down, restarting, and hibernating the computer. These commands
are marked as 'safe=False' because they can significantly impact the
system state.

Commands provided:
- "lock screen" - Lock the workstation
- "shut down in 5 minutes" - Schedule system shutdown
- "restart in 5 minutes" - Schedule system restart  
- "hibernate" - Put system into hibernation

Dependencies:
- os: For executing system commands

Safety Notes:
- All commands in this plugin are marked as safe=False
- Shutdown/restart commands use a 5-minute delay for safety
- These operations may cause data loss if unsaved work exists
- Hibernate may not work on all systems depending on configuration

Platform:
- Windows-specific commands using Windows system utilities

    Lock the current Windows workstation.
    
    This command immediately locks the screen, requiring the user to
    re-enter their password to access the system. This is useful for
    quickly securing the computer when stepping away.
    
    Returns:

    Example:
        result = do("lock screen")
