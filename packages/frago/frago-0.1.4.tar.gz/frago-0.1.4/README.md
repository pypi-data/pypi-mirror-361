# Frago

**Frago** is a reusable Django app that provides a secure, resumable, and parallel chunked file upload system. It supports large file uploads with resumable support, duplicate chunk detection, checksum verification, and customizable signal hooks ‚Äî ideal for drone videos, media applications, and IoT devices.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Parallel & resumable chunked uploads
- Upload tracking via database (start, end, size per chunk)
- Checksum verification (MD5 or other algorithms)
- Duplicate chunk detection
- Upload expiration support
- Extensible via Django signals
- Pluggable authentication (user/device/anonymous)
- Local file storage (pluggable)

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install frago

Add frago to your Django INSTALLED_APPS:
    # settings.py
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        "frago",
    ]

Finally, run the following commands to create and apply the migrations:

    python manage.py makemigrations frago
    
    python manage.py migrate
    
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (optional) 
```bash
you can confic these in settings.py

#üß† How the uploader identifies the upload session

CHUNKED_UPLOADER_IDENTIFIER_MODE = "user"
 Options: "anonymous" (default), "user"
 You can override get_identifier() for custom logic.

# üìÇ Where uploaded chunks are stored temporarily
CHUNKED_UPLOADER_CHUNK_UPLOAD_PATH = "chunked_uploads/"

# üìÇ Where final assembled files go
CHUNKED_UPLOADER_ASSEMBLED_PATH = "assembled_videos/"

# üîê Hash type for file integrity checks
CHUNKED_UPLOADER_CHECKSUM_TYPE = "md5"
 Any hashlib-supported algorithm (e.g., "sha256")

# ‚úÖ Whether to perform checksum verification
CHUNKED_UPLOADER_DO_CHECKSUM = True

# ‚è±Ô∏è Chunk expiration time (used for cleanup jobs)
CHUNKED_UPLOADER_EXPIRATION = timedelta(days=1)

# üì¶ Read buffer size during assembly
CHUNKED_UPLOADER_ASSEMBLE_READ_SIZE = 8 * 1024 * 1024  # 8MB

# üß± Custom chunk model path (if overriding)
CHUNKED_UPLOADER_CHUNK_MODEL = "frago.ChunkedUploadChunk"

# üß© Custom upload model path (if overriding)
CHUNKED_UPLOADER_UPLOAD_MODEL = "frago.ChunkUpload"
```

## üß© API Usage
    1. Start a new upload

```bash
        POST /upload/
        Request:
        {
        "filename": "video.mp4",
        "total_size": 104857600
        }

        Response:
        {
        "status": true,
        "upload_id": "uuid4-string",
        "message": "Upload started for video.mp4"
        }
```
    2. Upload a chunk

```bash
        PUT /upload/{upload_id}/

        Headers:
            Content-Range: bytes 0-1048575/104857600

        Body: multipart/form-data with key file and binary chunk data.
```    
    3. Finalize upload

```bash
        POST /upload/{upload_id}/

        Request
        {
        "checksum": "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",
        "checksum_algo": "md5"
        }

        Response
        {
        "status": true,
        "upload_id": "uuid4-string",
        "message": "Upload completed for video.mp4"
        }
```
    4. Get upload status (only for authenticated users)

```bash
        GET /upload/{upload_id}/

        Or list uploads by current user/device:
        GET /upload/
```

## üß† Models
    ChunkUpload

        Tracks a single upload:

            upload_id: UUID

            filename, total_size

            status: in_progress, complete, expired

            created_at, completed_at

    ChunkedUploadChunk

        Tracks individual uploaded chunks:

            start, end, size

            Foreign key to ChunkUpload

## üß∞ Signals

    Frago emits the following Django signals:
    Signal	Triggered When
        upload_started : New upload is created
        chunk_received	: A chunk is received and saved
        upload_completed : All chunks assembled, upload finalized
        checksum_failed : Checksum mismatch during finalization

    To extend behavior, connect signal handlers:

```bash
        from frago.signals import upload_started
        def my_handler(sender, upload, **kwargs):
            print("Upload started:", upload.filename)

        upload_started.connect(my_handler)
```

## üß™ Usage Example
    Add to your urls.py (if you are using with out any overides):
```bash

        path('api/',include('frago.urls')),
```

## üßº Cleanup:
    Uploads expire after a period (EXPIRATION) and are marked expired.
    Chunks and their metadata are deleted automatically on completion.


# OVERIDING

This is an example how you can overide and set your custome logic

## üîí Custom Authentication Example

By default, the view allows anonymous access. You should subclass the view and add authentication:

```bash
    from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
    from rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication import JWTAuthentication
    from frago.views import ParallelChunkedUploadView

    class SecureUploadView(ParallelChunkedUploadView):
        authentication_classes = [JWTAuthentication]
        permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
```

## üß† Overriding the Identifier
```bash
    class MyView(ParallelChunkedUploadView):
        authentication_classes = [CustomAuthentication]
        
        identifier_field = 'device'

        def get_identifier(self, request):
            if self.IDENTIFIER_MODE == 'device':
                
                device_id = request.user

                if not device_id:
                    raise PermissionDenied("Device ID not found.")

                try:
                    device = Devices.objects.get(inventory_id=device_id)
                    print('device',device.id)
                    return device  # or another unique identifier
                except Devices.DoesNotExist:
                    raise PermissionDenied("Invalid Device ID.")

            # fallback to parent logic
            return super().get_identifier(request)
        
```
Update your urls.py:

```bash
    urlpatterns = [
        path('upload/',MyView.as_view()),
        path('upload/<uuid:pk>/', MyView.as_view()),
    ]
```

## üîß Custom Upload Model Example
```bash
    class Mychunkupload(AbstractChunkUpload):
        device = models.ForeignKey(Devices,on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        

        def assembled_path(self):
            try:
                device = Devices.objects.get(inventory_id=self.device_id)
                base_path = device.videos or settings.ASSEMBLED_PATH
            except Exception as e:
                base_path = settings.ASSEMBLED_PATH
            return os.path.join(base_path, f'{self.filename}')
        
```
Register it in settings:

```bash
    CHUNKED_UPLOADER_UPLOAD_MODEL = 'fragotest.Mychunkupload'
```

and specify the identifier field in the view 

```bash
    identifier_field = 'device'
```
