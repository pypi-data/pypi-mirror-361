    "Needing a better way of ordering dictionaries was one of the original inspirations for Sciris back in 2014. In those dark days of Python <=3.6, dictionaries were unordered, which meant that `dict.keys()` could give you anything. (And you still can't do `dict.keys()[0]`, much less `dict[0]`). This tutorial describes Sciris' ordered dict, the `odict`, its close cousin the `objdict`, and its pandas-powered pseudorelative, the `dataframe`."
