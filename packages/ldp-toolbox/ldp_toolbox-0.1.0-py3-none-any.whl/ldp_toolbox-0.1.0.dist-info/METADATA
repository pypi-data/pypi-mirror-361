## LDP Toolbox: Exploring Utility and Attackability Tradeoffs in Local Differential Privacy

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ldp-toolbox.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ldp-toolbox)

**LDP Toolbox** is a Python package for analyzing, comparing, and visualizing Local Differential Privacy (LDP) protocols and their trade-offs between utility, privacy, and attackability.

This toolbox provides:
- 📊 Interactive dashboards powered by [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
- ⚙️ Protocol implementations for frequency estimation tasks
- 🗂️ Visual tools to compare utility loss (e.g., MSE, KL-divergence), attackability, and privacy budget ε
- 📈 Upload your own data to explore privacy-utility trade-offs

---

## 🚀 Installation

LDP Toolbox is available on PyPI. Install it with:

```bash
pip install ldp-toolbox
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

After installation, you can run the dashboard or use components in your own Python code.  
For example:

```python
from ldp_toolbox.toolbox.app import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `ldp_toolbox/`
  - `protocols/` — Core LDP protocol implementations
  - `toolbox/` — Dash front-end app (`assets/`, `pages/`, `app.py`)

Example datasets (`data/`) are provided in this repository for demonstration and local testing, but are not shipped with the PyPI package.

## 🤝 Contributing
LDP-Toolbox is a work in progress, and we expect to release new versions frequently, incorporating feedback and code contributions from the community.
