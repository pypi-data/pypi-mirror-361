# Reusable utils


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

To aid in the pedagogy of the tutorial, a lot of logic (e.g., data
processing, boilerplate training code, etc.) has been ported to this
small library of reusable utilities.

All notebooks are designed to be run using CPU only. Requirements can be
installed with:

    pip install amtutorial
