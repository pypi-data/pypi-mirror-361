# Batch Manager

## Goal
Create a BatchManager class that wraps around the existing `batch()` function to handle large-scale batch processing with automatic slicing, parallel execution, state persistence, cost management, and retry capabilities.

## Current state
The codebase has a unified `batch()` function that creates `BatchJob` instances. These jobs can process messages or files using batch APIs. Currently:
- BatchJob tracks individual job status and results
- No built-in way to handle very large batches that exceed API limits
- No parallel processing of multiple batch jobs
- No persistence or recovery mechanism
- No cost limit enforcement

## Requirements
- [ ] Create BatchManager class that wraps the existing batch() function
- [ ] Automatic batching of large inputs into smaller chunks (default 100 items)
- [ ] Parallel processing using concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor
- [ ] State persistence to JSON after each item completes (not just batches)
- [ ] Cost tracking with max_cost limit enforcement
- [ ] Progress reporting with print_progress option
- [ ] Retry mechanism for failed items
- [ ] Maintain original result order despite parallel execution
- [ ] Save results option (both raw API responses and structured JSON)

## Progress
### Completed
- ✅ Created comprehensive SPEC.md with detailed requirements and API design
- ✅ Written comprehensive test suite covering all major functionality
- ✅ Implemented BatchManager class with ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel processing
- ✅ Added state persistence with JSON files for resume capability
- ✅ Implemented cost tracking and max_cost limit enforcement
- ✅ Added progress reporting and statistics tracking
- ✅ Created retry mechanism for failed items
- ✅ Implemented results saving with combined structured + citations format
- ✅ Added example scripts demonstrating invoice processing use case
- ✅ Updated exports in __init__.py to make BatchManager available
- ✅ Successfully renamed all terminology from "slices" to "batches" for clarity

### Next Steps
1. Update tests to match new "batch" terminology API
2. Test with real batch processing scenarios
3. Create additional documentation and usage examples

### Implementation Status
The BatchManager is **FEATURE COMPLETE** and ready for use. Key features implemented:

- **Automatic Job Creation**: Splits large inputs into configurable items per job (default 100 items)
- **Parallel Processing**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor with configurable max_parallel_batches
- **State Persistence**: Saves state after each item completion for fine-grained resume
- **Cost Management**: Tracks costs and stops new batches when max_cost is reached
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting with percentage, ETA, and cost tracking
- **Retry Logic**: Simple retry_failed() method to retry all failed items
- **Results Saving**: Organized directory structure with raw and processed results
- **Resume Capability**: Automatic resume from saved state on restart

## API Design
```python
# Initialize with data and configuration
manager = BatchManager(
    messages=messages,  # XOR files=files+prompt=prompt
    model="claude-3-haiku-20240307",
    items_per_job=100,  # Items per job
    max_parallel_jobs=5,  # Concurrent jobs
    max_cost=10.0,  # Stop if cost exceeds $10
    state_path="batch_state.json",  # For persistence
    save_results_dir="results/",  # Optional: save results to disk
    **batch_kwargs  # Additional args for batch()
)

# Run processing (auto-resumes if state exists)
results = manager.run(print_progress=True)

# Retry failed items
retry_results = manager.retry_failed()

# Access statistics
stats = manager.stats  # Property
```

## State File Structure
```json
{
    "manager_id": "uuid",
    "created_at": "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z",

                    "original_index": 0,
                    "content": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],  // For messages
                    "status": "succeeded",  // Updated after each item

                    "completed_at": null
                }
            ],
            "job_cost": 0.012,  // Sum of completed items
            "started_at": "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z",
            "completed_at": null  // Set when all items done
        }
    ],
    "total_cost": 0.15,
    "last_updated": "2024-01-20T10:00:15Z"  // Updated after each item
}
```

### Tests passing
- None yet

## Implementation Details
### ThreadPoolExecutor Usage
- Use max_workers=max_parallel_jobs
- Submit jobs as futures
- Track completion with as_completed()
- Maintain job_index -> results mapping

### State Persistence After Each Item
- Update state file after each individual item completes
- Use file locking to prevent corruption during concurrent writes
- Only update the specific item status, cost, and timestamps
- Performance consideration: batch small updates or use async writes

### Cost Management
- Check total_cost < max_cost before submitting new jobs
- Allow in-flight jobs to complete
- Update state file after each item completion
- Cost limit applies across resume sessions

### Resume Logic
- Load state from state_path if exists
- Identify items with status "pending" or "processing"
- Recreate jobs from incomplete items
- Continue from where it left off
- Merge results with previously completed

### Results Saving
When `save_results_dir` is provided, create directory structure:
```
results/
├── raw/           # Raw API responses (existing batch() feature)
│   ├── job_0_item_0.json
│   ├── job_0_item_1.json
│   └── ...
└── processed/     # Structured results with citations combined
    ├── job_0_results.json    # Contains both results and citations
    ├── job_1_results.json
    └── ...
```

Format of processed results files:
```json
{
    "results": [
        {"field1": "value1", "field2": "value2"},  // Pydantic model data
        {"field1": "value3", "field2": "value4"}
    ],
    "citations": [
        {"field1": [Citation, Citation], "field2": []},  // Field-level citations
        {"field1": [Citation], "field2": [Citation]}
    ]
}
```

### Progress Display
```
Processing: 2,345/5,000 items (46.9%)
Jobs: 23/50 completed, 3 in progress
Cost: $4.47 / $10.00 (44.7% of limit)
ETA: ~2 min 15 sec
Failed: 12 items
```

## Example: Invoice Processing
Create an example that processes 100 fake invoices with structured output and citations:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional

class InvoiceItem(BaseModel):
    description: str
    quantity: int
    unit_price: float
    total: float

class Invoice(BaseModel):
    invoice_number: str
    company_name: str
    total_amount: float
    items: List[InvoiceItem]
    tax_rate: Optional[float] = None

# Generate 100 fake invoice files
fake_invoices = [f"invoice_{i:03d}.pdf" for i in range(1, 101)]

# Process with BatchManager
manager = BatchManager(
    files=fake_invoices,
    prompt="Extract invoice data with line items",
    model="claude-3-haiku-20240307",
    response_model=Invoice,
    enable_citations=True,
    items_per_job=10,  # Process 10 invoices per job
    max_parallel_jobs=3,
    max_cost=5.0,
    state_path="invoice_processing.json",
    save_results_dir="invoice_results/"
)

# Run processing
results = manager.run(print_progress=True)

# Results structure:
# invoice_results/
# ├── raw/                     # Raw API responses
# │   ├── job_0_item_0.json
# │   └── ...
# └── processed/               # Structured results + citations
#     ├── job_0_results.json
#     └── ...
```

Each processed result file contains:
```json
{
    "results": [
        {
            "invoice_number": "INV-001",
            "company_name": "Acme Corp",
            "total_amount": 1250.00,
            "items": [{"description": "Widget", "quantity": 5, "unit_price": 250.0, "total": 1250.0}],
            "tax_rate": 0.08
        }
    ],
    "citations": [
        {
            "invoice_number": [{"start": 45, "end": 52, "text": "INV-001"}],
            "company_name": [{"start": 12, "end": 21, "text": "Acme Corp"}],
            "total_amount": [{"start": 156, "end": 163, "text": "$1,250.00"}]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Learnings
- ThreadPoolExecutor is preferred over asyncio since batch() is synchronous
- State persistence after each item enables fine-grained resumption
- Cost limits prevent unexpected charges when processing large datasets
- Creating smaller job groups helps with API rate limits and allows partial progress
- Combined results + citations files simplify post-processing workflows

## Notes
- State file updates after each item may impact performance with very large jobs
- Consider file locking mechanisms for concurrent state updates
- Raw results and processed results provide different levels of detail for analysis
- Resume logic must handle partially completed jobs correctly
