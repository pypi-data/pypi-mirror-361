# mulch â€” Workspace Factory CLI

`mulch` is a lightweight, project-agnostic CLI tool to scaffold and generate workspace directories
for intentional, usable Python projects. It bootstraps a standardized workspace folder structure, an introspective templated `WorkspaceManager`, and other key files inside both your source directory and your workspaces directory.

Set up new projects easily with workspace scaffolding and source-code templating. 

Key feature: Benefit from introspective directory getters and file getters in the `WorkspaceManager` class, dictated by `mulch-scaffold.json` and protected by `mulch.lock`.

## Features

- Initialize workspaces with a consistent scaffold defined by `mulch-scaffold.json`
- Create a `default-workspace.toml` to track the active workspace
- Easily installable and runnable via `pipx`
- Uses a Pythonic `/package-root/src/pacakge-name/` paradigm
- Enforces a separation of source code and workspace files, with workspace files organized into  `/package-root/workspaces/your-special-workspace/` structure.

mulch file

# Initialize workspace named 'default' in the current directory
mulch init

# Initialize workspace named 'workspace1' in ./myproject
mulch init ./myproject --name workspace1

# Initialize workspace named 'workspace1' in the current directory
mulch init --name workspace1

# Skip creating default-workspace.toml
