A BioIO reader plugin for reading tiled OME TIFF files using `bfio`

---


## Documentation

[See the full documentation on our GitHub pages site](https://bioio-devs.github.io/bioio/OVERVIEW.html) - the generic use and installation instructions there will work for this package.

Information about the base reader this package relies on can be found in the `bioio-base` repository [here](https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio-base)

## Installation

**Stable Release:** `pip install bioio-ome-tiled-tiff`<br>
**Development Head:** `pip install git+https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio-ome-tiled-tiff.git`

## Example Usage (see full documentation for more examples)

Install bioio-ome-tiled-tiff alongside bioio:

`pip install bioio bioio-ome-tiled-tiff`


This example shows a simple use case for just accessing the pixel data of the image
by explicitly passing this `Reader` into the `BioImage`. Passing the `Reader` into
the `BioImage` instance is optional as `bioio` will automatically detect installed
plug-ins and auto-select the most recently installed plug-in that supports the file
passed in.
```python
from bioio import BioImage
import bioio_ome_tiled_tiff

img = BioImage("my_file.ome.tiff", reader=bioio_ome_tiff.Reader)
img.data
```
