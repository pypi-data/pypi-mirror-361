class SignalBarrier(IDisposable):
    """
    SignalBarrier
    ------------------
    A reusable, synchronization primitive that acts like a *count-to-N barrier*.
    Once a predefined number of threads (the `threshold`) have called `wait()`, all
    waiting threads are released simultaneously. This release can occur automatically
    or be manually triggered, depending on the configuration.

    üí° Core Features:
    -----------------
    ‚Ä¢ **Count-based Trigger**: Threads block until the `threshold` number of waiters is reached.
    ‚Ä¢ **Optional Reusability**: Can be configured to reset after releasing all threads.
    ‚Ä¢ **Manual Release Option**: Allows controller or external caller to trigger release manually.
    ‚Ä¢ **Controller Integration**: Emits lifecycle events and supports remote invocation.
    ‚Ä¢ **Timeout-aware**: Threads can specify a timeout for `wait()`.

    üîÅ Reusable Behavior:
    ---------------------
    If `reusable=True`, once all waiting threads pass the barrier, the internal count is
    reset automatically and the semaphore becomes ready for reuse. The last thread to pass
    is responsible for resetting the internal state.

    üîê Manual Release:
    ------------------
    If `manual_release=True`, the barrier is *not* released automatically when the threshold is met.
    Instead, a manual call to `release()` is required to proceed.

    üîß Controller Integration:
    --------------------------
    When integrated with a Controller instance:
    ‚Ä¢ Self-registers on creation.
    ‚Ä¢ Emits the following events:
        - "THRESHOLD_MET": When the threshold is first reached.
        - "SEMAPHORE_RELEASED": When threads are actually unblocked.
    ‚Ä¢ Supports command-based control via:
        - `release()`, `reset()`, `set_threshold()`, `is_spent()`, `notify_all_override()`, `dispose()`
    ‚Ä¢ Provides a `signal_callback` hook (e.g., `controller.on_wait_starting`) to signal blocking activity.

    ‚öô Parameters:
    -------------
    threshold (int):
        Number of threads required to reach the release point.
    callback (Optional[Union[Callable[..., None], Pack]]):
        A function invoked once when the threshold is reached (before releasing threads).
    reusable (bool):
        If True, the semaphore resets itself after each full release cycle. Default is False.
    manual_release (bool):
        If True, prevents automatic release and requires an explicit call to `release()`.
    controller (Optional[Controller]):
        A `Controller` instance used for central management and event emission.
    signal_callback (Optional[Union[Callable[..., None], Pack]]):
        A hook called just before a thread blocks in `wait()`. Typically used to notify a controller.

    üö® Exceptions:
    --------------
    Raises ValueError if `threshold <= 0`.

    üß™ Typical Use Case:
    --------------------

        semaphore = SignalBarrier(threshold=5, reusable=True)
