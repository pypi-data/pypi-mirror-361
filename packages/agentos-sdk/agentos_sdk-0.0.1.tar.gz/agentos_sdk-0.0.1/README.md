## Overview

AgentOS is a lightweight, single-file implementation that provides a robust foundation for building autonomous AI agents. It implements the core concepts outlined in Karpathy's Agent OS architecture while maintaining simplicity and extensibility.

## Features

- **Unified Model Interface**: Seamless integration with multiple LLM providers through LiteLLM
  - Support for Anthropic Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
  - Integration with OpenAI GPT models
  - Access to optimized variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- **Browser Automation**: Built-in browser agent capabilities for web interaction using browser-use
- **Multi-Modal Support**: 
  - Text processing and generation
  - Video analysis through Google's Gemini models
  - Audio processing and speech synthesis
  - Image handling capabilities
- **Resource Management**: 
  - Efficient handling of computational resources
  - Dynamic model selection based on task requirements
  - Automatic GPU/CPU optimization
- **HuggingFace Integration**: 
  - Direct access to open-source models
  - Support for text generation and multiple NLP tasks
  - Automatic model quantization and optimization
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new capabilities and tools

## Core Components

- **Model Management**: Dynamic selection and utilization of language models
- **Browser Automation**: Autonomous web-based task execution
- **Resource Orchestration**: Efficient management of computational resources
- **Context Management**: Maintains system state and task dependencies

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from agentos import AgentOS

# Initialize AgentOS
agent_os = AgentOS()

# Run a task
result = agent_os.run(
    task="Your task description",
    img="optional_image.jpg",
    video="optional_video.mp4",
    audio="optional_audio.mp3"
)
```
