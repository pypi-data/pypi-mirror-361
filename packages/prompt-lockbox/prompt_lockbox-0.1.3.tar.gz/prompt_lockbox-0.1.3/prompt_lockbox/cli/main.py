"""
This file serves as the main entry point for the PromptLockbox (plb) CLI.

It uses the Typer library to construct the command-line interface by importing
and assembling various command functions and command groups from other modules
within the 'cli' package. It organizes commands into Rich help panels for a
clean and user-friendly --help output.
