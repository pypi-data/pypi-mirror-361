#59 : split :mod:`lino.apps.pcsw` to a independant project 
==========================================================

The following modules are the ones that make up "Lino for PCSWs" 
and should one day be 
maintained by some organization other than me:


- :mod:`lino.modlib.courses`
- :mod:`lino.modlib.newcomers`
- :mod:`lino.modlib.jobs`
- :mod:`lino.modlib.isip`
- :mod:`lino.modlib.cbss`
- :mod:`lino.modlib.debts`
- :mod:`lino.modlib.households`
- :mod:`lino.apps.pcsw`


Some day I'll split them out of the 
main Lino repository to a separate googlecode 
project.
Biggest problem is the name of that new Google project.

- "lino-pcsw" is conceptually correct, but difficult to 
  pronounce and not very beautiful.
- "lino-cpas" is more beautiful, but discriminating against flemish PCSWs.
- a completely new name ("Sara" has been a candidate) 
  seems not possible since users are already used to "Lino".
