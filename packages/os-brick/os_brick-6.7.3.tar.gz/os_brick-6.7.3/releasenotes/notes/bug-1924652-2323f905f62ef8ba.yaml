    `Bug #1924652 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1924652>`_: Fix
    issue with newer multipathd implementations where path devices are kept
    in multipathd even after volume detachment completes, preventing it from
    creating a multipath device when a new device attachment is made shortly
    with the same volume device or the same device path.
