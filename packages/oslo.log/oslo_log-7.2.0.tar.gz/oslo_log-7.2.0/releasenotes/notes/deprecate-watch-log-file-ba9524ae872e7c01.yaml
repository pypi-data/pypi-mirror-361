deprecations:
  - |
    The ``watch_log_file`` option has been deprecated and will be removed in
    a future release.

upgrade:
  - |
    Setting ``[DEFAULT] watch_log_file = True`` now raises RuntimeError while
    configuring logger. The feature has been broken for multiple cycles and
    depends on pyinotify library which is not maintained now.
