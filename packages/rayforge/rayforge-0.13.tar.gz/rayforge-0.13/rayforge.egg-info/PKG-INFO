# Rayforge

Rayforge is a software for laser cutters and engravers. It runs on Linux and
maybe on Windows, though the latter is pretty much untested.

It supports direct communication with GRBL based machines (network or serial).

## Installation

### Linux

On Linux the only currently supported method is Snap:

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/en/light/install.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/rayforge)

You can also install it through PIP if you know what you are doing. Something like this:

```
sudo apt install python3-pip-whl python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-adw-1 libgirepository-1.0-dev libgirepository-2.0-0 libvips42t64

pip3 install rayforge
```

### Other operating systems

There is currently no installer for other operating systems - contributions are
welcome, in the form of Github workflow actions or build instructions.

If you know what you are doing, you may be able to install manually using
PIP on Windows or Mac - the source code should be fully cross-platform.
