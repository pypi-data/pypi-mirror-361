- Can be answered using only the information present in the provided context
- Are clear, specific, and relevant to the context
- Vary in complexity (include both simple factual and more analytical questions when possible)
- Comply with content filtering policies (no unsafe, offensive, or inappropriate content)

Return only the list of questions, one per line, with no additional commentary or explanation.
