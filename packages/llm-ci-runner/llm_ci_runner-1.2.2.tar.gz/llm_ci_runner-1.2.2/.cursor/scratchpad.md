*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

# Mode: COMPLETED âœ…
Current Task: Fix ruff linting errors in core.py and io_operations.py

## Task Summary:
**Status**: COMPLETED âœ…  
**Result**: All 8 ruff linting errors successfully fixed

## Issues Fixed:
1. **F841 - Unused Variable**: Removed unused `logger` variable in core.py line 63
   - Solution: Removed assignment since `LOGGER` module constant already available
   
2. **B904 - Exception Chaining**: Added proper exception chaining in io_operations.py
   - Fixed 7 raise statements to use `from e` for better error tracebacks
   - Locations: YAML/JSON parsing, file I/O error handling

## Verification:
- âœ… `uv run ruff check --fix *.py llm_ci_runner/` â†’ "All checks passed!"
- âœ… `uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v` â†’ 113/113 tests passing
- âœ… Code quality maintained with all existing comments preserved
- âœ… No functional changes - only linting compliance improvements

## Next Available Tasks:
- Integration test failures (from previous scratchpad context)
- Other development tasks as needed

Confidence: 100% (task completed successfully)


# Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯
Current Task: Fix integration test failures after migration to modular structure
Understanding: 10 integration tests are failing because mock paths haven't been updated for modular structure. Tests are trying to patch old single-file paths but services are now in separate modules.

## Root Cause Analysis âœ…
**Issue**: Integration tests are patching incorrect module paths after modularization
- **Current patch**: `"llm_ci_runner.setup_azure_service"` (single-file path)
- **Correct patch**: `"llm_ci_runner.core.setup_azure_service"` (modular path)
- **Reason**: `core.py` imports `setup_azure_service` from `azure_service` module
- **Impact**: Mock isn't applied, real Azure service called â†’ AuthenticationError â†’ SystemExit: 1

## Test Failure Pattern Analysis:
1. **9 tests failing with SystemExit: 1**: Authentication error because mock not applied
2. **1 test not raising SystemExit**: Mock path issue causing different behavior  
3. **Similar to unit test fixes**: Need to update import paths from single-file to modular

## Confirmed Fix Strategy:
**Replace vs Fix Approach** - Update mock paths systematically:
1. Update `test_examples_integration.py` mock paths: `llm_ci_runner.setup_azure_service` â†’ `llm_ci_runner.core.setup_azure_service`
2. Update `test_main_function.py` mock paths (same pattern)
3. Verify all integration mock fixtures use correct modular paths
4. Test incremental fixes to ensure pattern works

## Questions:
1. âœ… Are the integration tests using old import paths? **YES - using single-file paths**
2. âœ… Are they calling functions that have changed module locations? **YES - setup_azure_service**
3. âœ… Are there mock path issues similar to unit tests? **YES - exact same pattern**
4. âœ… Are there missing imports or incorrect API usage? **NO - API usage is correct**
5. âœ… Do tests need new modular entry points? **NO - just mock path updates**

Confidence: 95% (exact same pattern as unit test fixes, clear solution identified)

Next Steps:
- [X] Examine failing integration test files âœ…
- [X] Identify SystemExit causes and mock issues âœ…  
- [X] Compare with working unit test patterns âœ…
- [X] Confirmed systematic fix approach âœ…
- [ ] Apply mock path fixes to test_examples_integration.py
- [ ] Apply mock path fixes to test_main_function.py  
- [ ] Test incremental fixes
- [ ] Verify all 10 tests pass
