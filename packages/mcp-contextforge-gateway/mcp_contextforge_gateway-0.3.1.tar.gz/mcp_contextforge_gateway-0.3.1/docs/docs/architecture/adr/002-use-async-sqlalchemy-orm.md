# ADR-0002: Use Async SQLAlchemy ORM

- *Status:* Accepted
- *Date:* 2025-02-01
- *Deciders:* Mihai Criveti

## Context

The gateway must persist:

- Tool metadata
- Resource configurations
- Usage metrics
- Peer discovery and federation state

We require a relational database with schema evolution, strong typing, and async support. The current codebase already uses SQLAlchemy ORM models with an async engine and declarative mapping style.

## Decision

We will use:

- **SQLAlchemy 2.x (async)** for all data persistence.
- **AsyncSession** and `async with` scoped transactions.
- **Alembic** for migrations, with autogeneration and CLI support.
- **SQLite** for development; **PostgreSQL or MySQL** for production via `DATABASE_URL`.

This provides consistent, well-understood relational behavior and integrates cleanly with FastAPI.

## Consequences

- ðŸ§± Mature and reliable ORM with a wide developer base.
- ðŸ”„ Fully async I/O stack without thread-pools or blocking.
- ðŸ”§ Migrations handled declaratively using Alembic.
- ðŸ“„ Pydantic models can be derived from or synchronized with SQLAlchemy models if needed.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| **Raw asyncpg / aiosqlite** | Manual query strings, error-prone joins, no built-in migrations. |
| **Tortoise ORM / GINO** | Less widely used, more magic, lower confidence in long-term maintainability. |
| **Django ORM** | Not async-native, tightly coupled to Django ecosystem, too heavyweight. |
| **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)** | No relational guarantees, weaker query language, major refactor from current SQL-based model. |

## Status

This decision is in place and all gateway persistence uses SQLAlchemy 2.x with async support.
