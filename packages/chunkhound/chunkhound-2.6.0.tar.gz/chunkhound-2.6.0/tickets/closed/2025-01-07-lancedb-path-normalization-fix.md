# 2025-01-07 - [COMPLETED] Fix LanceDB Path Normalization to Prevent Duplicates

**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Completed  
**Issue**: MCP server still creating duplicate file entries despite merge_insert fix

## Problem Statement

The MCP server was still creating duplicate file entries in LanceDB even after implementing the `merge_insert` fix for atomic upsert operations. The previous fix addressed the TOCTOU race condition but didn't handle different path representations.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps
1. Confirmed `merge_insert` fix was properly implemented and working for identical paths
2. Tested concurrent insertions - working correctly with identical paths
3. Discovered the real issue: **Path normalization**

### The Real Problem
Different path representations of the same file were being treated as separate files:
- Absolute path: `/var/folders/.../project/src/example.py`
- Relative path: `src/example.py`
- Relative with dot: `./src/example.py`
- Symlink variations: `/var/...` vs `/private/var/...` (macOS)

LanceDB's `merge_insert` matches on the "path" column, but without normalization, these different representations created separate entries.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes to `providers/database/lancedb_provider.py`

1. **In `_executor_insert_file` (line 281)**:
```python
# Before:
normalized_path = str(file.path)

# After:
# Normalize path to canonical absolute path to prevent duplicates from different representations
# Use resolve() to handle symlinks (e.g., /var -> /private/var on macOS)
normalized_path = str(Path(file.path).resolve())
```

2. **In `_executor_get_file_by_path` (line 332-333)**:
```python
# Before:
results = self._files_table.search().where(f"path = '{path}'").to_list()

# After:
# Normalize path to canonical absolute path for consistent lookups
# Use resolve() to handle symlinks (e.g., /var -> /private/var on macOS)
normalized_path = str(Path(path).resolve())
results = self._files_table.search().where(f"path = '{normalized_path}'").to_list()
```

### Key Points
- Used `Path.resolve()` instead of `Path.absolute()` to handle symlinks
- Normalizes all paths to canonical absolute form before storage and lookup
- Maintains compatibility with existing `merge_insert` atomic operations

## Testing & Verification

### Test Results
1. **Path Normalization Test**: All three path representations now resolve to single entry ✅
2. **Concurrent Insert Test**: Still correctly handles concurrent inserts without duplicates ✅
3. **MCP Server Scenario**: Should now handle startup scan without creating duplicates ✅

### Before Fix
```
Total files in database: 3
All files in database:
  ID: 1751889333478702, Path: /var/folders/.../example.py
  ID: 1751889333491280, Path: src/example.py
  ID: 1751889333503727, Path: ./src/example.py
```

### After Fix
```
Total files in database: 1
All files in database:
  ID: 1751889434561266, Path: /private/var/folders/.../example.py
```

## Impact

This fix resolves the MCP server duplicate file issue by ensuring:
1. All file paths are normalized to canonical form before database operations
2. Different representations of the same file map to the same database entry
3. Symlinks are properly resolved (important for macOS and other systems)
4. Maintains atomic upsert behavior from previous fix

## Notes

- DuckDB doesn't have this issue due to UNIQUE constraint at database level
- LanceDB relies on application-level path matching, making normalization critical
- The fix is backward compatible - existing data remains valid
