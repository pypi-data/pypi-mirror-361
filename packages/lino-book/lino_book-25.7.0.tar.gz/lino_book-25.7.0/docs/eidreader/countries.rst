Supported countries
====================

Currently supported countries are Estonia_ and Belgium_.
Contributions for other countries are welcome (please contact the
author before doing a lot of work).

Estonia
-------

The original version was largely inspired by 
a `blog post by Revo at Codeborne 
<http://blog.codeborne.com/2010/10/javaxsmartcardio-and-esteid.html>`_.

Belgium
-------

EIDReader imports and uses three classes from 
`eid-applet <https://code.google.com/p/eid-applet>`_
because the mere parsing of the information found on Belgian eID cards 
is very complex.
