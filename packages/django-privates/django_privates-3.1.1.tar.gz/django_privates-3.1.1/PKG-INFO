What does it do?
================

Django supports file uploads for user-generated content out of the box, which is
typically *public* - think of images, videos...

However, often you want to expose files only to correctly authenticated users because
they have a sensitive nature, for example invoice PDFs or tenant-specific documents.

django-privates achieves the latter while being as convenient as Django's core
``FileField`` and derivatives.

Usage
=====

The installation and usage `documentation`_ is hosted on ReadTheDocs.
