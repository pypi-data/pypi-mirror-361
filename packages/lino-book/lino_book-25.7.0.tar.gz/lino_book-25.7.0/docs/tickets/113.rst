#113 [closed]: Creating invoices in :ref:`cosi`
===============================================

There were several problems:

- VouchersByPartner should show a shortcurt link to unregistered
  vouchers (i.e. to their MTI children).
- A sales invoice is created in table ledger_invoice instead of
  sales_invoice. Seems that there is some misundertanding when
  generating the `insert_button` in
  the :meth:`dd.AbstractTable.get_table_summary` of
  :class:`ml.accounting.VouchersByPartner`.

- Lino does not show the detail window on the created invoice.
