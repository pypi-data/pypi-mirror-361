              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# onc: client library for accessing Oceans 3.0 API

[![PyPI Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/onc.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/onc/)
[![PyPI Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/onc.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/onc/)
[![License - Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/onc.svg)](https://github.com/OceanNetworksCanada/api-python-client/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)
[![Frontiers in Marine Science Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.3389%2Ffmars.2022.806452-blue)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.806452)

onc is a Python client library that facilitates access to scientific data hosted by [Ocean Networks Canada](https://oceannetworks.ca)
through the [Oceans 3.0 API](https://data.oceannetworks.ca/OpenAPI) public web services.
It can help you explore and download our data, by consuming our
_[discovery](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/Oceans3.0-API/API_Guide.html#discovery-methods)_,
_[data product download](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/Oceans3.0-API/API_Guide.html#data-product-download-methods)_,
_[archive file download](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/Oceans3.0-API/API_Guide.html#archive-file-download-methods)_, and
_[near real-time data access](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/Oceans3.0-API/API_Guide.html#near-real-time-data-access-methods)_ services.

# Getting Started

## Installation

onc can be installed from PyPI:

```shell
pip install onc
```

## Obtaining a token

A unique Oceans 3.0 API token is required to access our data.
To obtain a token, follow the steps below:

1. Register for an Oceans 3.0 account at <https://data.oceannetworks.ca/Registration>.

2. Log into your account at <https://data.oceannetworks.ca> by clicking the Log In link.

3. Click the _Profile_ link (top right corner) to access your account profile.

4. Access the _Web Services API_ tab and click _Copy Token_.

5. If you forget your token, you can always find it again in your Oceans 3.0 account profile.

## Searching with discovery methods

To download ONC data, you need to specify the type of data you require
and where in particular (i.e. location, device) it originates from.

In the Oceans 3.0 API, there's a unique code that identifies every location, device, property, data product type, etc.
Include these codes in a group of filters (these will be used as URL parameters when making HTTP requests)
that determine the data you're interested in.

Discovery methods allow you to explore the hierarchy of the ONC database to obtain the codes for your filters
(they work like a "search" function).

The example below uses the `getLocations` method to search for locations that include "Burrard" in their name (i.e. "Burrard Inlet"):

```python
from onc import ONC

onc = ONC("YOUR_TOKEN")

onc.getLocations({"locationName": "Burrard"})
```

The previous code prints a list with locations that match the search filters provided.
Each location in the list includes a _dataSearchURL_ that points to the Data Search Tool,
and a _locationCode_ ("BIPP" and "BISS" in this example) that can be used to continue searching "inside" it,
as in the following example:

```python
onc.getDeviceCategories({"locationCode": "BIIP"})
onc.getDataProducts({"locationCode": "BIIP", "deviceCategoryCode": "CTD"})
```

Check more on the _[discovery methods guide](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/Oceans3.0-API/API_Guide.html#discovery-methods)_
and _[code examples](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/api-python-client/Code_Examples/index.html)_.

## Downloading data products

Once you determine the exact dictionary of filters that identifies the data you are interested in,
there are multiple methods to download it.

One method is to request the ONC servers to generate a custom data product with the data.
This is done through the data product download methods.

The following example downloads two PNG files with plots for 30 seconds of data from a CTD in Campbell River:

```python
params = {
    "locationCode": "BIIP",
    "deviceCategoryCode": "CTD",
    "dataProductCode": "TSSP",
    "extension": "png",
    "dateFrom": "2019-06-20T00:00:00.000Z",
    "dateTo": "2019-06-20T00:30:00.000Z",
    "dpo_qualityControl": "1",
    "dpo_resample": "none",
}
onc.orderDataProduct(params, includeMetadataFile=False)
```

The filters above include codes for location, deviceCategory, and dataProduct,
as well as the file extension and a time interval (in UTC).
They also include a couple of filters to configure this specific data product type (starting with the "dpo\_" prefix),
which can be obtained from the [Data Product Options](https://wiki.oceannetworks.ca/display/DP/Data+Product+Options) documentation.
You can download more than 120 different [types of data products](https://wiki.oceannetworks.ca/display/O2A/Available+Data+Products) including audio & video.

Check more on the _[data product download methods guide](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/Oceans3.0-API/API_Guide.html#data-product-download-methods)_
and _[code examples](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/api-python-client/Code_Examples/Download_Data_Products.html)_.

## Obtaining sensor readings in (near) real-time

Another method to obtain ONC data is by directly obtaining a time series of sensor readings
(available as soon as they reach our database).

In the following example, we obtain 5 seconds of conductivity readings from the CTD at Burrard Inlet:

```python
params = {
    "locationCode": "BIIP",
    "deviceCategoryCode": "CTD",
    "propertyCode": "conductivity",
    "dateFrom": "2019-06-20T00:00:00.000Z",
    "dateTo": "2019-06-20T00:00:05.000Z",
}
onc.getScalardata(params)

# Longer method name
# onc.getScalardataByLocation(params)
```

The result includes matching lists of "values" and "sampleTimes" (increases performance for long time ranges).
We also use the property code "conductivity" to limit results to a specific property available in this CTD.

Check more on the _[near real-time data access methods guide](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/Oceans3.0-API/API_Guide.html#near-real-time-data-access-methods)_
and _[code examples](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/api-python-client/Code_Examples/Request_Real_Time_Data.html)_.

## Downloading archived files

ONC scripts auto-generate and archive data products of different types at set time intervals.
You can directly download these data product files from our files archive, as long as you know their unique filename.

In the following example, we get a list of archived files available for a camera at Ridley Island (in a certain time span),
and download one of the files:

```python
params = {
    "locationCode": "RISS",
    "deviceCategoryCode": "VIDEOCAM",
    "dateFrom": "2016-12-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "dateTo": "2016-12-01T00:05:00.000Z",
}
result = onc.getArchivefile(params, allPages=True)

# Longer method name
# result = onc.getArchivefileByLocation(params, allPages=True)

# Download one of the files from result["files"]
onc.downloadArchivefile("AXISQ6044PTZACCC8E334C53_20161201T000001.000Z.jpg", overwrite=True)
```

You can use the method `downloadArchivefile()` as above to download individual files or the method `downloadDirectArchivefile()`
to download all the files that match your filters.

Alternatively, if you prefer using a download manager like [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) or [Free Download Manager](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/), `getArchivefileUrls` and `getArchivefileUrl` can return the download URLs of the archivefile
without downloading the files.

Check more on the _[archive file download methods guide](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/Oceans3.0-API/API_Guide.html#archive-file-download-methods)_
and _[code examples](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/api-python-client/Code_Examples/Download_Archived_Files.html)_.

# Documentation

The client library documentation is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://oceannetworkscanada.github.io/api-python-client).
For documentation and examples about Oceans 3.0 API, visit the [wiki](https://wiki.oceannetworks.ca/display/O2A/Oceans+3.0+API+Home)
and [OpenAPI](https://data.oceannetworks.ca/OpenAPI) page on the Oceans 3.0 Data Portal website.

# Multithreading issue

We kindly ask users to **not** use too many threads when using threading/multiprocessing libraries on download tasks.
It can cause issues for both server and client and may not appreciably increase download speeds.
