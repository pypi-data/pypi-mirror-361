# ConfReady

The [ARR Responsible NLP Research checklist](https://aclrollingreview.org/responsibleNLPresearch/) encourages best practices in research ethics, societal impact, and reproducibility. ConfReady helps authors reflect on their work by using **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to answer checklist questions â€” and provides a framework to **evaluate how large language models respond to ethical prompts**.
