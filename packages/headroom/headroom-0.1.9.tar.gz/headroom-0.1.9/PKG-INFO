**Max> A Command-line AI Agent**

---

## Overview

**Max** is a powerful, extensible command-line AI assistant. It can:
- Connect to local or cloud based LLMs
- Interpret natural language commands
- Run system tools and shell commands safely (with confirmation)
- Manage files, directories, packages, and more
- Provide interactive chat and planning features

---

## Installation

```sh
pip install headroom

```sh
max
```

Type natural language requests or commands, for example:
- `create a new directory called test`
- `copy file.txt to backup/`
- `install package requests`
- `help`
- `exit`

Max will confirm actions before running anything that changes your system and remeber your preferences.
