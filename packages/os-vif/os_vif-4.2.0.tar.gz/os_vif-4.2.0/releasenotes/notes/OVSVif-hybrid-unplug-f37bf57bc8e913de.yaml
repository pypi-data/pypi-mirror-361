    The unplug() method for VIFOpenVSwitch type now checks for existence of
    linux bridge used in hybrid plugging mechanism. In case it exists, the
    interfaces related to the hybrid plugging are deleted too. This is useful
    in particular for cold migration use case when target node has updated
    port binding that doesn't use hybrid plugging, while the original plugging
    was hybrid.
