# SimpleBroker

*A lightweight message queue backed by SQLite. No setup required, just works.*

```bash
$ pipx install simplebroker
$ broker write tasks "ship it 🚀"
$ broker read tasks
ship it 🚀
```

SimpleBroker gives you a zero-configuration message queue that runs anywhere Python runs. It's designed to be simple enough to understand in an afternoon, yet powerful enough for real work.

## Features

- **Zero configuration** - No servers, daemons, or complex setup
- **SQLite-backed** - Rock-solid reliability with true ACID guarantees  
- **Concurrent safe** - Multiple processes can read/write simultaneously
- **Simple CLI** - Intuitive commands that work with pipes and scripts
- **Portable** - Each directory gets its own isolated `.broker.db`
- **Fast** - 1000+ messages/second throughput
- **Lightweight** - ~1500 lines of code, no external dependencies

## Installation

```bash
# Install with uv 
uv add simplebroker

# Or with pip
pip install simplebroker

# Or with pipx for global installation (recommended)
pipx install simplebroker
```

The CLI is available as both `broker` and `simplebroker`.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- SQLite 3.35+ (released March 2021) - required for `DELETE...RETURNING` support

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a queue and write a message
$ broker write myqueue "Hello, World!"

# Read the message (removes it)
$ broker read myqueue
Hello, World!

# Write from stdin
$ echo "another message" | broker write myqueue -

# Read all messages at once
$ broker read myqueue --all

# Peek without removing
$ broker peek myqueue

# List all queues
$ broker list
myqueue: 3

# Broadcast to all queues
$ broker broadcast "System maintenance at 5pm"

# Clean up when done
$ broker --cleanup
```

## Command Reference

### Global Options

- `-d, --dir PATH` - Use PATH instead of current directory
- `-f, --file NAME` - Database filename or absolute path (default: `.broker.db`)
  - If an absolute path is provided, the directory is extracted automatically
  - Cannot be used with `-d` if the directories don't match
- `-q, --quiet` - Suppress non-error output (intended reads excepted)
- `--cleanup` - Delete the database file and exit
- `--version` - Show version information
- `--help` - Show help message

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `write <queue> <message>` | Add a message to the queue |
| `write <queue> -` | Add message from stdin |
| `read <queue> [--all] [--json] [-t\|--timestamps] [--since <ts>]` | Remove and return message(s) |
| `peek <queue> [--all] [--json] [-t\|--timestamps] [--since <ts>]` | Return message(s) without removing |
| `list` | Show all queues and message counts (note: counts are a snapshot and may change during concurrent operations) |
| `purge <queue>` | Delete all messages in queue |
| `purge --all` | Delete all queues |
| `broadcast <message>` | Send message to all existing queues |

#### Read/Peek Options

- `--all` - Read/peek all messages in the queue
- `--json` - Output in line-delimited JSON (ndjson) format for safe handling of special characters
- `-t, --timestamps` - Include timestamps in output
  - Regular format: `<timestamp>\t<message>` (tab-separated)
  - JSON format: `{"message": "...", "timestamp": <timestamp>}`
- `--since <timestamp>` - Return only messages with timestamp > the given value
  - Accepts multiple formats:
    - Native 64-bit timestamp as returned by `--timestamps` (e.g., `1837025672140161024`)
    - ISO 8601 date/datetime (e.g., `2024-01-15`, `2024-01-15T14:30:00Z`)
      - Date-only strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`) are interpreted as the beginning of that day in UTC (00:00:00Z)
      - Naive datetime strings (without timezone) are assumed to be in UTC
    - Unix timestamp in seconds (e.g., `1705329000` or from `date +%s`)
    - Unix timestamp in milliseconds (e.g., `1705329000000`)
  - **Explicit unit suffixes** (strongly recommended for scripts):
    - `1705329000s` - Unix seconds
    - `1705329000000ms` - Unix milliseconds  
    - `1705329000000000000ns` - Unix nanoseconds
    - `1837025672140161024hyb` - Native hybrid timestamp
    - **Best practice**: While automatic detection is convenient for interactive use, we strongly recommend using explicit unit suffixes in scripts and applications to ensure predictable behavior and future-proof your code
  - **Automatic disambiguation**: Integer timestamps without suffixes are interpreted based on magnitude:
    - Values < 2^44 are treated as Unix timestamps (seconds, milliseconds, or nanoseconds)
    - Values ≥ 2^44 are treated as native hybrid timestamps
    - This heuristic works reliably until the year ~2527
  - Native format: high 44 bits are milliseconds since Unix epoch, low 20 bits are a counter
  - Note: time.time() returns seconds, so the native format is `int(time.time() * 1000) << 20`
  - Most effective when used with `--all` to process all new messages since a checkpoint
  - Without `--all`, it finds the oldest message in the queue that is newer than `<timestamp>` and returns only that single message

### Exit Codes

- `0` - Success
- `1` - General error
- `2` - Queue is empty

## Examples

### Basic Queue Operations

```bash
# Create a work queue
$ broker write work "process customer 123"
$ broker write work "process customer 456"

# Worker processes tasks
$ while msg=$(broker read work 2>/dev/null); do
    echo "Processing: $msg"
    # do work...
done
```

### Using Multiple Queues

```bash
# Different queues for different purposes
$ broker write emails "send welcome to user@example.com"
$ broker write logs "2023-12-01 system started"
$ broker write metrics "cpu_usage:0.75"

$ broker list
emails: 1
logs: 1
metrics: 1
```

### Fan-out Pattern

```bash
# Send to all queues at once
$ broker broadcast "shutdown signal"

# Each worker reads from its own queue
$ broker read worker1  # -> "shutdown signal"
$ broker read worker2  # -> "shutdown signal"
```

**Note on broadcast behavior**: The `broadcast` command sends a message to all *existing* queues at the moment of execution. There's a small race window - if a new queue is created after the broadcast starts but before it completes, that queue won't receive the message. This is by design to keep the operation simple and atomic.

### Integration with Unix Tools

```bash
# Store command output
$ df -h | broker write monitoring -
$ broker peek monitoring

# Process files through a queue
$ find . -name "*.log" | while read f; do
    broker write logfiles "$f"
done

# Parallel processing with xargs
$ broker read logfiles --all | xargs -P 4 -I {} process_log {}

# Use absolute paths for databases in specific locations
$ broker -f /var/lib/myapp/queue.db write tasks "backup database"
$ broker -f /var/lib/myapp/queue.db read tasks
```

### Safe Handling with JSON Output

Messages containing newlines, quotes, or other special characters can break shell pipelines. The `--json` flag provides a safe way to handle any message content:

```bash
# Problem: Messages with newlines break shell processing
$ broker write alerts "ERROR: Database connection failed\nRetrying in 5 seconds..."
$ broker read alerts | wc -l
2  # Wrong! This is one message, not two

# Solution: Use --json for safe handling
$ broker write alerts "ERROR: Database connection failed\nRetrying in 5 seconds..."
$ broker read alerts --json
{"message": "ERROR: Database connection failed\nRetrying in 5 seconds..."}

# Parse JSON safely in scripts
$ broker read alerts --json | jq -r '.message'
ERROR: Database connection failed
Retrying in 5 seconds...

# Multiple messages with --all --json (outputs ndjson)
$ broker write safe "Line 1\nLine 2"
$ broker write safe 'Message with "quotes"'
$ broker write safe "Tab\there"
$ broker read safe --all --json
{"message": "Line 1\nLine 2"}
{"message": "Message with \"quotes\""}
{"message": "Tab\there"}

# Parse each line with jq
$ broker read safe --all --json | jq -r '.message'
Line 1
Line 2
Message with "quotes"
Tab	here
```

The JSON output uses line-delimited JSON (ndjson) format:
- Each message is output on its own line as: `{"message": "content"}`
- This format is streaming-friendly and works well with tools like `jq`

This is the recommended approach for handling messages that may contain special characters, as mentioned in the Security Considerations section.

### Timestamps for Message Ordering

The `-t/--timestamps` flag includes message timestamps in the output, useful for debugging and understanding message order:

```bash
# Write some messages
$ broker write events "server started"
$ broker write events "user login"
$ broker write events "file uploaded"

# View with timestamps (non-destructive peek)
$ broker peek events --all --timestamps
1837025672140161024	server started
1837025681658085376	user login
1837025689412308992	file uploaded

# Read with timestamps and JSON for parsing
$ broker read events --all --timestamps --json
{"message": "server started", "timestamp": 1837025672140161024}
{"message": "user login", "timestamp": 1837025681658085376}
{"message": "file uploaded", "timestamp": 1837025689412308992}

# Extract just timestamps with jq
$ broker peek events --all --timestamps --json | jq '.timestamp'
1837025672140161024
1837025681658085376
1837025689412308992
```

Timestamps are 64-bit hybrid values:
- High 44 bits: milliseconds since Unix epoch (equivalent to `int(time.time() * 1000)`)
- Low 20 bits: logical counter for ordering within the same millisecond
- This guarantees unique, monotonically increasing timestamps even for rapid writes

### Checkpoint-based Processing

The `--since` flag enables checkpoint-based consumption patterns, ideal for resilient processing:

```bash
# Process initial messages
$ broker write tasks "task 1"
$ broker write tasks "task 2"

# Read first task and save its timestamp
$ result=$(broker read tasks --timestamps)
$ checkpoint=$(echo "$result" | cut -f1)
$ echo "Processed: $(echo "$result" | cut -f2)"

# More tasks arrive while processing
$ broker write tasks "task 3"
$ broker write tasks "task 4"

# Resume from checkpoint - only get new messages
$ broker read tasks --all --since "$checkpoint"
task 2
task 3
task 4

# Alternative: Use human-readable timestamps
$ broker peek tasks --all --since "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
task 3
task 4

# Or use Unix timestamp from date command
$ broker peek tasks --all --since "$(date -d '1 hour ago' +%s)"
task 4
```

This pattern is perfect for:
- Resumable batch processing
- Fault-tolerant consumers
- Incremental data pipelines
- Distributed processing with multiple consumers

Note that simplebroker may return 0 (SUCCESS) even if no messages are returned if the
queue exists and has messages, but none match the --since filter.

### Robust Worker with Checkpointing

Here's a complete example of a resilient worker that processes messages in batches and can resume from where it left off after failures:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# resilient-worker.sh - Process messages with checkpoint recovery

QUEUE="events"
CHECKPOINT_FILE="/var/lib/myapp/checkpoint"
BATCH_SIZE=100

# Load last checkpoint (default to 0 if first run)
if [ -f "$CHECKPOINT_FILE" ]; then
    last_checkpoint=$(cat "$CHECKPOINT_FILE")
else
    last_checkpoint=0
fi

echo "Starting from checkpoint: $last_checkpoint"

# Main processing loop
while true; do
    # Read batch of messages since checkpoint
    # Note: 'read' is destructive - it removes messages from the queue
    output=$(broker read "$QUEUE" --all --json --timestamps --since "$last_checkpoint" | head -n "$BATCH_SIZE")
    
    # Check if we got any messages
    if [ -z "$output" ]; then
        echo "No new messages, sleeping..."
        sleep 5
        continue
    fi
    
    echo "Processing new batch..."
    
    # Process each message
    echo "$output" | while IFS= read -r line; do
        message=$(echo "$line" | jq -r '.message')
        timestamp=$(echo "$line" | jq -r '.timestamp')
        
        # Process the message (your business logic here)
        echo "Processing: $message"
        if ! process_event "$message"; then
            echo "Error processing message, will retry on next run"
            echo "Checkpoint remains at last successful message: $last_checkpoint"
            # Exit without updating checkpoint - failed message will be reprocessed
            exit 1
        fi
        
        # Atomically update checkpoint ONLY after successful processing
        echo "$timestamp" > "$CHECKPOINT_FILE.tmp"
        mv "$CHECKPOINT_FILE.tmp" "$CHECKPOINT_FILE"
        
        # Update our local variable for next iteration
        last_checkpoint="$timestamp"
    done
    
    echo "Batch complete, checkpoint at: $last_checkpoint"
done
```

Key features of this pattern:
- **Atomic checkpoint updates**: Uses temp file + rename for crash safety
- **Per-message checkpointing**: Updates checkpoint after each successful message (no data loss)
- **Batch processing**: Processes up to BATCH_SIZE messages at a time for efficiency
- **Failure recovery**: On error, exits without updating checkpoint so failed message is retried
- **Efficient polling**: Only queries for new messages (timestamp > checkpoint)
- **Progress tracking**: Checkpoint file persists exact progress across restarts

### Remote Queue via SSH

```bash
# Write to remote queue
$ echo "remote task" | ssh server "cd /app && broker write tasks -"

# Read from remote queue  
$ ssh server "cd /app && broker read tasks"
```

## Design Philosophy

SimpleBroker follows the Unix philosophy: do one thing well. It's not trying to replace RabbitMQ or Redis - it's for when you need a queue without the complexity.

**What SimpleBroker is:**
- A simple, reliable message queue
- Perfect for scripts, cron jobs, and small services
- Easy to understand and debug
- Portable between environments

**What SimpleBroker is not:**
- A distributed message broker
- A pub/sub system
- A replacement for production message queues
- Suitable for high-frequency trading

## Technical Details

### Storage

Messages are stored in a SQLite database with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) enabled for better concurrency. Each message is stored with:

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,  -- Ensures strict FIFO ordering
    queue TEXT NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    ts INTEGER NOT NULL                       -- Millisecond timestamp + hybrid logical clock 
)
```

The `id` column guarantees global FIFO ordering across all processes.
Note: FIFO ordering is strictly guaranteed by the `id` column, not the timestamp.

### Concurrency

SQLite's built-in locking handles concurrent access. Multiple processes can safely read and write simultaneously. Messages are delivered **exactly once** by default using atomic `DELETE...RETURNING` operations.

**Delivery Guarantees**
- **Default behavior**: All reads (single and bulk) provide exactly-once delivery with immediate commits
- **Performance optimization**: For bulk reads (`--all`), you can trade safety for speed by setting `BROKER_READ_COMMIT_INTERVAL` to a number greater than 1 to batch messages. If a consumer crashes mid-batch, uncommitted messages remain in the queue and will be redelivered to the next consumer (at-least-once delivery).

**FIFO Ordering Guarantee:**
- **True FIFO ordering across all processes**: Messages are always read in the exact order they were written to the database, regardless of which process wrote them
- **Guaranteed by SQLite's autoincrement**: Each message receives a globally unique, monotonically increasing ID
- **No ordering ambiguity**: Even when multiple processes write simultaneously, SQLite ensures strict serialization

### Performance

- **Throughput**: 1000+ messages/second on typical hardware
- **Latency**: <10ms for write, <10ms for read
- **Scalability**: Tested with 100k+ messages per queue

### Security

- Queue names are validated (alphanumeric + underscore + hyphen + period only, can't start with hyphen or period)
- Message size limited to 10MB
- Database files created with 0600 permissions
- SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries

**Security Considerations:**
- **Message bodies are not validated** - they can contain any text including newlines, control characters, and shell metacharacters
- **Shell injection risks** - When piping output to shell commands, malicious message content could execute unintended commands
- **Special characters** - Messages containing newlines or other special characters can break shell pipelines that expect single-line output
- **Recommended practice** - Always sanitize or validate message content before using it in shell commands or other security-sensitive contexts

### Environment Variables

SimpleBroker can be configured via environment variables:

- `BROKER_BUSY_TIMEOUT` - SQLite busy timeout in milliseconds (default: 5000)
- `BROKER_CACHE_MB` - SQLite page cache size in megabytes (default: 10)
  - Larger cache improves performance for repeated queries and large scans
  - Recommended: 10-50 MB for typical workloads, 100+ MB for heavy use
- `BROKER_SYNC_MODE` - SQLite synchronous mode: FULL, NORMAL, or OFF (default: FULL)
  - `FULL`: Maximum durability, safe against power loss (default)
  - `NORMAL`: ~25% faster writes, safe against app crashes, small risk on power loss
  - `OFF`: Fastest but unsafe - only for testing or non-critical data
- `BROKER_READ_COMMIT_INTERVAL` - Number of messages to read before committing in `--all` mode (default: 1)
  - Default of 1 provides exactly-once delivery guarantee (~10,000 messages/second)
  - Increase for better performance with at-least-once delivery guarantee
  - With values > 1, messages are only deleted after being successfully delivered
  - Trade-off: larger batches hold database locks longer, reducing concurrency
