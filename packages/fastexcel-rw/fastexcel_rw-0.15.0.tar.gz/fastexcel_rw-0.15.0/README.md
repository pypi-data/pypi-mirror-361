This is a fork of [ToucanToco/fastexcel](https://github.com/ToucanToco/fastexcel) with **Excel writing functionality** added.

## üöÄ What's New

This fork extends the original fastexcel library with:

- **Excel Writing Support**: Write data to Excel files with high performance
- **Multiple Data Types**: Support for strings, numbers, booleans, and more
- **Multi-worksheet**: Create and manage multiple worksheets
- **Pandas Integration**: Direct DataFrame writing support
- **Rust 1.88.0 Support**: Updated to latest Rust version

## üìà Performance

- **3.8x faster** than Python xlsxwriter
- **9.4x faster** than openpyxl
- **Memory efficient** with Rust's zero-copy design

## üîß Installation

### Quick Install from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bryanhan1001/fastexcel-rw.git
```

### Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bryanhan1001/fastexcel-rw.git
cd fastexcel-rw

# Install with writer feature
maturin develop --features writer

# Or build wheel
maturin build --features writer
```

## üíª Usage

### Writing Excel Files

```python
import fastexcel

# Create writer
writer = fastexcel.create_excel_writer("output.xlsx")

# Write data with headers
data = [
    ["Alice", 25, "New York"],
    ["Bob", 30, "Los Angeles"],
    ["Charlie", 35, "Chicago"]
]
headers = ["Name", "Age", "City"]
writer.write_sheet_data(data, "Sheet1", headers)

# Save file
writer.save()
```

### Writing DataFrames

```python
import pandas as pd
import fastexcel

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
})

# Write to Excel
writer = fastexcel.create_excel_writer("dataframe.xlsx")
writer.write_dataframe(df, "Sheet1")
writer.save()
```

## üîÑ Reading Excel Files

The original reading functionality remains unchanged:

```python
import fastexcel

# Read Excel file
excel_file = fastexcel.read_excel("data.xlsx")
sheet = excel_file.load_sheet_by_name("Sheet1")
data = sheet.to_arrow()
```
