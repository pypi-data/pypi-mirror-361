# Deluge Compatibility Layer

A Python compatibility layer that allows you to execute Deluge scripts within Python environments. This project provides a runtime environment and translator that converts Deluge language syntax to Python, enabling testing and execution of Deluge scripts outside of their native environment.

## Features

- **Complete Data Type Support**: Implements Deluge's Map, List, and String types with all their methods
- **Built-in Functions**: HTTP requests, encoding/decoding, mathematical operations, and utility functions
- **Script Translation**: Converts Deluge syntax to executable Python code
- **Runtime Environment**: Provides a sandboxed execution context for Deluge scripts
- **Zobot Support**: Full SalesIQ/Zobot development with interactive chat simulation
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for running Deluge scripts from Python

## Installation

### Full Installation (Recommended)

Includes CLI tools, rich output formatting, and all features:

```bash
# Install from PyPI (when published)
pip install deluge-compat

# Or with uv
uv add deluge-compat

# Or from source
git clone git@github.com:jctosta/deluge-compat.git
cd deluge-compat
uv install
```

### Slim Installation

For minimal dependencies in environments where you only need the core compatibility layer:

```bash
pip install deluge-compat[slim]
# or
uv add deluge-compat[slim]
```

The slim version excludes CLI tools and rich formatting but retains all core translation and execution capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Command Line Tools

The package provides CLI tools for working with Deluge scripts:

#### Running Deluge Scripts

```bash
# Run a Deluge script file
deluge-run my_script.dg

# Run with JSON output
deluge-run my_script.dg --json

# Run with verbose output
deluge-run my_script.dg --verbose
```

#### Translating Deluge Scripts to Python

```bash
# Translate a Deluge script to Python
deluge-translate my_script.dg --output converted.py
```

#### Interactive Zobot Chat Testing

```bash
# Test Zobot scripts with interactive chat
deluge-chat my_zobot.dg

# Use specific visitor data
deluge-chat my_zobot.dg --visitor-mock-source json --visitor-mock-file visitor_data.json

# Automated testing with predefined messages
deluge-chat my_zobot.dg --message-mock-source json --message-mock-file test_messages.json
```

For detailed usage information, see our [documentation](#documentation).

### Basic Usage Examples

```python
from deluge_compat import run_deluge_script

# Simple script execution
result = run_deluge_script('''
    response = Map();
    response.put("greeting", "Hello World!");
    return response;
''')
print(result)  # {'greeting': 'Hello World!'}

# With context variables
result = run_deluge_script('''
    greeting = "Hello " + username + "!";
    return Map({"message": greeting});
''', username="Alice")
print(result['message'])  # "Hello Alice!"
```

### Translation to Python

```python
from deluge_compat import translate_deluge_to_python

# Generate PEP 723 compatible Python script
python_code = translate_deluge_to_python('''
    numbers = List([1, 2, 3]);
    sum = 0;
    for each num in numbers {
        sum = sum + num;
    }
    return Map({"sum": sum});
''')

# Save and run with: uv run script.py
with open("script.py", "w") as f:
    f.write(python_code)
```

- **Translation Examples**: Converting Deluge to Python with PEP 723 support

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage with **143 total tests** (115 core + 28 SalesIQ) achieving **100% success rate**.

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Test specific functionality
uv run pytest tests/test_types.py      # Data types
uv run pytest tests/test_salesiq.py    # SalesIQ/Zobot features
uv run pytest tests/test_showcase.py   # Working features demo
```
