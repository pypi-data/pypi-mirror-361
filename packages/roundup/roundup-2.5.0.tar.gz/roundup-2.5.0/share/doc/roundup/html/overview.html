<section id="introduction">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2" role="doc-backlink">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Roundup is an issue-tracking system called which will manage a
number of issues (with properties such as “description”, “priority”,
and so on) and provides the ability to:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>submit new issues,</p></li>
<li><p>find and edit existing issues, and</p></li>
<li><p>discuss issues with other participants.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Roundup facilitates communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited.</p>
<section id="background">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3" role="doc-backlink">Background</a></h3>
<p>A typical software project requires the management of
many tasks, usually distributed among several collaborators.
In fact, any project team
could use a tool for sorting out and discussing all the
relevant issues.  A common approach is to set up some kind
of “to-do” list that people can share.</p>
<p>However, to address the overall problem we need much more
than just a shared to-do list; we need to
manage a growing body of knowledge and experience to help a
team collaborate effectively on a project.  The issue-tracking
tool becomes a nexus for communication: the Grand Central
Station of the group intelligence.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this design is to help
developers work together well, not to provide a customer
service interface to the developers.  This is not to say that
the design is to be made unsuitable for customers to use.
Rather, it is assumed that many of the same qualities
that are good for supporting development (see below)
are also good for non-developers using the system.
Additional niceties
for providing a safe or simplified interface to clients are
intentionally deferred for later consideration.</p>
<p>A good issue-tracking system should have at least the
following properties:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>Low barrier to participation</strong></dt><dd><p>The usefulness of the tool depends entirely on the
information people contribute to it.  It must be made
as easy as possible to submit new issues and contribute
information about existing issues.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Straightforward navigation</strong></dt><dd><p>It should be easy for users to extract information they need
from the system to direct their decisions and tasks.
They should be able to get a decent overview of
things as well as finding specific information when
they know what they’re after.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Controlled information flow</strong></dt><dd><p>The users must have control over how much information and
what information they get.  A common flaw of some issue-tracking
systems is that they inundate users with so much useless
e-mail that people avoid the system altogether.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>With a nod to the time-honoured computer science tradition
of “filling in the fourth quadrant”, we note that
there are really four kinds of information flow
going on here.  The three mentioned qualities
really address the first three quadrants of this 2-by-2 matrix,
respectively:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>User push: a user submits information to the system.</p></li>
<li><p>User pull: a user queries for information from the system.</p></li>
<li><p>System push: the system sends information out to users.</p></li>
<li><p>System pull: the system solicits information from users.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>An example of the fourth kind of flow is voting.
Voting isn’t described in this design,
but it should be noted as a potential enhancement.</p>
</section>
<section id="guiding-principles">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4" role="doc-backlink">Guiding Principles</a></h3>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>Simplicity</strong></dt><dd><p>It is a strong requirement
that the tool be accessible and understandable.  It should
be fairly obvious what different parts of the interface do,
and the inner mechanisms should operate in ways that most
users can easily predict.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Efficiency</strong></dt><dd><p>We aim to optimize for minimum effort to do the most common
operations, and best use of resources like screen real estate
to maximize the amount of information that we summarize and present.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Generality</strong></dt><dd><p>We try to avoid making
unnecessary assumptions that would restrict the applicability
of the tool.  For example, there is no reason why one might
not also want to use this tool to manage a design process,
non-software projects, or organizational decisions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Persistence</strong> We</dt><dd><p>prefer hiding or reclassifying information to deleting it.
This helps support the collection of statistics later.
If records are never destroyed, there is little danger
in providing access to a larger community, and logging yields
accountability, which may encourage better behaviour.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
</section>
<section id="data-model">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" role="doc-backlink">Data Model</a></h2>
<p>Roundup stores a number of <em>items</em>, each of
which can have several properties and an associated discussion.
The properties can be used to classify or search for items.
The discussion is a sequence of e-mail messages.
Each item is identified by a unique number, and has
an activity log which
records the time and content of edits made on its properties.
The log stays fairly small since the design intentionally
provides only small data types as item properties, and
encourages anything large to be attached to
e-mail where it becomes part of the discussion.
The next section explains how items are organized.</p>
<section id="the-hyperdatabase">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" role="doc-backlink">The Hyperdatabase</a></h3>
<p>Often when classifying information we are
asked to select exactly one of a number of categories
or to fit it into a rigid hierarchy.  Yet things
only sometimes fall into one category; often,
a piece of information may be related to several concepts.</p>
<p>For example, forcing each item into a single keyword
category is not just suboptimal but counterproductive:
seekers of that
item may expect to find it in a different category
and conclude that the item is not present in the
database – which has them <em>worse</em> off
than if the items were not categorized at all.</p>
<p>Some systems try to alleviate this problem by
allowing items to appear at multiple locations
in a tree, as with “aliases” or “symbolic links” in
a filesystem, for example.  This does help somewhat,
but we want to be even more flexible
by allowing the
organization of items into sets that may freely
intersect.  Rather than putting each item at exactly
one place in an overall “grand scheme”, a item can
belong to as many sets as are appropriate.</p>
<p>If we choose to represent the sets themselves as items
and set membership as a link between items,
we’re now ready to present the definition of a
hyperdatabase.</p>
<p>A <em>hyperdatabase</em> is a collection of <em>items</em>
that may be hyperlinked to
each other (hence the name “hyperdatabase”).
Each item carries a collection of key-value pairs,
where some of the values may be links to other items.
Any item may have an arbitrary number of outgoing and
incoming links.  Hyperdatabases are able to efficiently
answer queries such as “what items link to this item?”
and “what items does this item link to?”</p>
</section>
<section id="rationale">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" role="doc-backlink">Rationale</a></h3>
<p>There are several reasons for building our
own kind of database for Roundup rather than using an existing one.</p>
<p>Requiring the installation of a full-blown third-party
SQL database system would probably deter many potential
users from attempting to set up Roundup;
yet a real relational database would be too
complicated to implement on our own.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a hyperdatabase can be implemented fairly easily
using one of the Python DBM modules, so we can
take the “batteries-included” approach and provide it
as part of the system.  It’s easier to build and understand
than a true relational database (in accordance with our guiding
principle of <em>simplicity</em>), but provides
most of the query functionality we want.</p>
<p>A hyperdatabase is well suited for finding the intersection
of a number of sets in which items belong.  We expect that
most of the queries people want to do will be of this
form, rather than complicated SQL queries.  For example, a
typical request might be
“show me all critical items related to security”.
The ability to store arbitrary key-value pairs and links
on items gives it more flexibility than an RDBMS.</p>
<p>Users are not going to be making thousands of queries
per second, so it makes sense to optimize for simplicity
and flexibility rather than performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="roundup-s-hyperdatabase">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" role="doc-backlink">Roundup’s Hyperdatabase</a></h3>
<p>For our application, we store each item as a item in a
hyperdatabase.  The item’s properties are stored
as key-value pairs on its item.
Several types of properties are allowed:
<em>string</em>, <em>number</em>, <em>boolean</em>, <em>date</em>, <em>interval, *link</em>,
and <em>multlink</em>. Another type, <em>password</em>, is a special type
of string and it’s only used internally to Roundup.</p>
<p>The <em>string</em> type is for short, free-form strings.
String properties are not intended to contain large
amounts of text, and it is recommended that they be presented
as one-line fields to encourage brevity. A <em>number</em> is a special
type of string that represents a numeric value. A <em>boolean</em> is
further constrained to be a <em>true</em> or <em>false</em> value.</p>
<p>The <em>date</em> type is for calendar dates and times. An <em>interval</em>
is the time between two dates.</p>
<p>The <em>link</em> type denotes a single selection from a number of
options.  A <em>link</em> property entails a link from the item
possessing the property to the item representing the chosen option.</p>
<p>The <em>multilink</em> type is for a list of links to any
number of other items in the in the database.  A <em>multilink</em>
property, for example, can be used to refer to related items
or keyword categories relevant to an item.</p>
<p>For Roundup, all items have four properties that are not customisable:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>a <em>date</em> property named <strong>creation</strong></p></li>
<li><p>a <em>link</em> property named <strong>creator</strong></p></li>
<li><p>a <em>date</em> property named <strong>activity</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>These properties represent the date of the creation of the item, who
created it, and when the last change was made.</p>
<p>Further, all <em>issue</em> items have an additional four properties:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>a <em>string</em> property named <strong>title</strong></p></li>
<li><p>a <em>multilink</em> property named <strong>nosy</strong></p></li>
<li><p>a <em>multilink</em> property named <strong>messages</strong></p></li>
<li><p>a <em>multilink</em> property named <strong>files</strong></p></li>
<li><p>a <em>multilink</em> property named <strong>superseder</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>title</strong> property is a short one-line description of the item.
The detailed description can go in the first e-mail message of the
item’s messages spool.</p>
<p>The <strong>nosy</strong> property contains a list of
the people who are interested in an item.  This
mechanism is explained in the section on <a class="reference internal" href="#submission-and-discussion">Submission and Discussion</a>.</p>
<p>Each message added to the item goes in the <strong>messages</strong> spool - any
attached files go in the <strong>files</strong> spool.</p>
<p>The <strong>superseder</strong> property is used to
support the splitting, joining, or replacing of items.
When several items need to be
joined into a single item, all the old items
link to the new item in their <strong>superseder</strong>
property.
When an item needs to be split apart, the item
references all the new items in its <strong>superseder</strong>
propety.
We can easily list all active items just by checking
for an empty <strong>superseder</strong> property, and trace
the path of an item’s origins by querying the hyperdatabase
for links.</p>
<p>Users of the system are also represented by items in the
hyperdatabase, containing properties
like the user’s e-mail address, login name, and password.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-default-schema">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" role="doc-backlink">The Default Schema</a></h3>
<p>It is hoped that the hyperdatabase together with the
specializations mentioned above for Roundup will be
applicable in a variety of situations
(in accordance with our guiding principle of <em>generality</em>).</p>
<p>To address the problem at hand, we need
a specific schema for items applied particularly to software development.
Again, we are trying to keep the schema simple: too many
options make it tougher for someone to make a good choice:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># IssueClass automatically gets these properties:</span>
<span class="c1">#   title = String()</span>
<span class="c1">#   messages = Multilink(&quot;msg&quot;)</span>
<span class="c1">#   files = Multilink(&quot;file&quot;)</span>
<span class="c1">#   nosy = Multilink(&quot;user&quot;)</span>
<span class="c1">#   superseder = Multilink(&quot;issue&quot;)</span>
<span class="c1">#   (it also gets the Class properties creation, activity and creator)</span>
<span class="n">issue</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">IssueClass</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">db</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;issue&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

                <span class="n">priority</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Link</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;priority&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Link</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;status&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <strong>assignedto</strong> property assigns
responsibility for an item to a person or a list of people.
The <strong>keyword</strong> property places the
item in an arbitrary number of relevant keyword sets (see
the section on <a class="reference internal" href="#browsing-and-searching">Browsing and Searching</a>).</p>
<p>The <strong>prority</strong> and <strong>status</strong> values are initially:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Priority</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Description</p></th>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>As previously mentioned, each item gets an activity log.
Whenever a property on an item is changed, the log
records the time of the change, the user making the change,
and the old and new values of the property.  This permits
the later gathering of statistics (for example, the average time
from submission to resolution).</p>
<p>We do not specify or enforce a state transition graph,
since making the system rigid in that fashion is probably more
trouble than it’s worth.
Experience has shown that there are probably
two convenient automatic state transitions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>from <strong>unread</strong> to <strong>chatting</strong> when e-mail is written about an item</p></li>
<li><p>from <strong>testing</strong> to <strong>resolved</strong> when a new release of the software is made</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond these, in accordance with our principle of <em>generality</em>,
we allow access to the hyperdatabase
API so that scripts can automate transitions themselves or
be triggered by changes in the database.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10" role="doc-backlink">User Interface</a></h2>
<p>Roundup provides its services through two main interfaces:
e-mail and the Web.
This division is chosen to optimize the most common tasks.</p>
<p>E-mail is best suited for
the submission of new items since most people are most comfortable
with composing long messages in their own favourite e-mail client.
E-mail also permits them to mention URLs or attach files relevant
to their submission.  Indeed, in many cases people are already
used to making requests by sending e-mail to a mailing list
of people; they can do exactly the same thing to use Roundup
without even thinking about it.
Similarly, people are already
familiar with holding discussions in e-mail, and plenty of
valuable usage conventions and software tools already exist for that medium.</p>
<p>The Web, on the other hand, is best suited for summarizing
and seeking information, because it can present an interactive
overview of items.  Since the Web has forms, it’s also
the best place to edit items.</p>
<section id="submission-and-discussion">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11" role="doc-backlink">Submission and Discussion</a></h3>
<p>The system needs an address for receiving mail
and an address that forwards mail to all participants.
Each item has its own list
of interested parties, known as its <em>nosy list</em>.
Here’s how nosy lists work:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>New items are always submitted by sending an e-mail message
to Roundup.  The “Subject:” field becomes the description
of the new item.
The message is saved in the mail spool of the new item,
and copied to the list of all participants
so everyone knows that a new item has been added.
The new item’s nosy list initially contains the submitter.</p></li>
<li><p>All e-mail messages sent by Roundup have their “Reply-To:”
field set to Roundup’s address, and have the item’s
number in the “Subject:” field.  Thus, any replies to the
initial announcement and subsequent threads are all received
by Roundup.  Roundup notes the item number in the “Subject:”
field of each incoming message and appends the message
to the appropriate spool.</p></li>
<li><p>Any incoming e-mail tagged with an item number is copied
to all the people on the item’s nosy list,
and any users found in the “From:”, “To:”, or “Cc:” fields
are automatically added to the nosy list.  Whenever a user
edits an item’s properties in the Web interface, they are
also added to the nosy list.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The effect is like each item having its own little mailing list,
except that no one ever has to worry about subscribing to
anything.  Indicating interest in an issue is sufficient, and if you
want to bring someone new into the conversation, all you need to do
is “Cc:” a message to them.  It turns out that no one ever has to worry
about unsubscribing, either: the nosy lists are so specific in scope
that the conversation tends to die down by itself when the issue is
resolved or people no longer find it sufficiently important.</p>
<p>Each nosy list is like an asynchronous chat room,
lasting only a short time (typically five or ten messages)
and involving a small group of people.  However, that
group is the <em>right</em> group of people:
only those who express interest in an item in some way
ever end up on the list, so no one gets spammed with mail they
don’t care about, and no one who <em>wants</em>
to see mail about a particular item needs to be left
out, for they can easily join in, and just as easily
look at the mail spool on an item to catch up on any
messages they might have missed.</p>
<p>We can take this a step further and
permit users to monitor particular keywords or classifications of items
by allowing other kinds of items to also have their own nosy lists.
For example, a manager could be on the
nosy list of the priority value item for “critical”, or a
developer could be on the nosy list of the keyword value item for “security”.
The recipients are then determined by the union of the nosy lists on the
item and all the items it links to.</p>
<p>Using many small, specific mailing lists results
in much more effective communication than one big list.
Taking away the effort of subscribing and unsubscribing
gives these lists the “feel” of being cheap and
disposable.</p>
<p>The transparent capture of the mail spool attached to each
issue also yields a nice knowledge repository over time.</p>

<section id="editing">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12" role="doc-backlink">Editing</a></h3>
<p>Since Roundup is intended to support arbitrary user-defined
schema for item properties, the editing interface must be
automatically generated from the schema.  The configuration for
Roundup will include a template describing how to lay out the
properties to present a UI for inspecting and editing items.
For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">tr</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
 <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">th</span> <span class="n">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;required&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">Priority</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">th</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
 <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">td</span> <span class="n">tal</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;structure context/priority/menu&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">priority</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">td</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
 <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">th</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">Status</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">th</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
 <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">td</span> <span class="n">tal</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;structure context/status/menu&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">status</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">td</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">tr</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To display the editing form for an item, Roundup inserts
an HTML form widget where it encounters an expression like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tal:content=&quot;structure</span> <span class="pre">context/priority/menu&quot;</span></code>.
Each type has its own appropriate editing widget:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>string</em> and <em>number</em> properties appear as text fields</p></li>
<li><p><em>boolean</em> properties appear as a yes/no selection</p></li>
<li><p><em>date</em> and <em>interval</em> properties appear as text fields</p></li>
<li><p><em>link</em> properties appear as selection lists</p></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt><em>multilink</em> properties appear as multiple-selection lists</dt><dd><p>or text fields with pop-up widgets for larger selections.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We foresee the use of custom date fields for things like deadlines,
so input fields for <em>date</em> properties support a
simple way of specifying relative dates (such as “3w” for
“three weeks from now”).</p>
<p>The <strong>superseder</strong> property is a special case:
although it is more efficient to store a <strong>superseder</strong>
property in the superseded item, it makes more sense to provide
a “supersedes” edit field on the superseding item.  We use
a special widget on items for this purpose (a text field containing
a comma-separated list of items).  Links in the <strong>superseder</strong> property
appear on both the superseding and superseded items to
facilitate navigating an item’s pedigree.</p>
<p>After the editing widgets, the item inspection page shows
a “note” text box and then a display of the messages in the
discussion spool.  This field
lets you enter a note explaining your change when you edit the
item, and the note is included in the notification message that
goes out to tell the interested parties on the nosy list of
your edits.</p>
</section>
<section id="browsing-and-searching">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13" role="doc-backlink">Browsing and Searching</a></h3>
<p>The ideal we would like to achieve is to make searching as
much like browsing as possible: the user simply clicks about
on things that seem interesting, and the information narrows
down comfortably until the goal is in sight.  This is preferable
to trying to digest a screen filled with widgets and buttons
or entering a search expression in some arcane algebraic syntax.</p>
<p>While a one-shot search may be appropriate when you’re
looking for a single item and you know exactly what you want, it’s
not very helpful when you want an overview of
things (“Gee, there are a lot more high-priority items than
there were last week!”) or trying to do comparisons (“I have
some time today, so who is busiest and could most use some help?”)</p>
<p>The browsing interface presents filtering
functionality for each of the properties in the schema.  As with
editing, the interface is generated from a template
describing how to lay out the properties.
Each type of property has its own appropriate filtering widget:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>string</em> properties appear as text fields supporting
case-insensitive substring match</p></li>
<li><p><em>date</em> properties appear as a text field which accepts a date
range with start, end or both. Multiple date ranges can be specified
separated by a comma. An empty date can be searched for by specifying
‘-’ instead of a date range</p></li>
<li><p><em>link</em> properties appear as a group of selectable options
(the filter selects the <em>union</em> of the sets of items
associated with the active options)</p></li>
<li><p><em>multilink</em> properties appear as a group of selectable options
(the filter selects the <em>intersection</em> of the sets of items
associated with the active options)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For a <em>multilink</em> property like <strong>keyword</strong>,
one possibility is to show, as hyperlinks, the keywords whose
sets have non-empty intersections with the currently displayed set of
items.  Sorting the keywords by popularity seems
reasonable.  Clicking on a keyword then narrows both the list of items
and the list of keywords.  This gives some of the feel of walking
around a directory tree – but without the restriction of having
to select keywords in a particular hierarchical order, and without
the need to travel all the way to the leaves of the tree before
any items are visible.</p>
<p>Below the filtering form is a listing of items, with their
properties displayed in a table.  Rows in the table are
generated from a template, as with the editing interface.
This listing is the central overview of the system, and it
should aim to maximize the density of
useful information in accordance with our guiding principle of
<em>efficiency</em>.  Colour may be used to indicate
the status of each item to help the eye sift through the index quickly.</p>
<p>Roundup sorts items
in groups by priority, and then within groups by the date
of last activity.  This reveals at a glance where discussion is
most active, and provides an easy way for anyone to move an issue
up in the list.</p>
<p>The page produced by a given set of browsing options constitutes
an <em>index</em>.  The options should all be part of the query
parameters in the URL so that views may be bookmarked.  An index
specifies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>search strings for string properties</p></li>
<li><p>date ranges for date properties</p></li>
<li><p>acceptable values for choice properties</p></li>
<li><p>required values for reference properties</p></li>
<li><p>a sorting key</p></li>
<li><p>a grouping key</p></li>
<li><p>a list of properties for which to display filtering widgets</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our default index is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>all <strong>status</strong> values except “resolved”</p></li>
<li><p>show <strong>priority</strong> and <strong>fixer</strong></p></li>
<li><p>grouping by <strong>priority</strong> in sections</p></li>
<li><p>sorting by decreasing <strong>activity</strong> date</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The starting URL for Roundup immediately presents the listing of
items generated by this default index, with no preceding query screen.</p>
