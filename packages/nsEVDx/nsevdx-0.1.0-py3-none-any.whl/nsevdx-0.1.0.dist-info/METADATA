# nsEVDx: A python Library for modelling non-stationary extreme value distributions

`nsEVDx` is a Python library for estimating the parameters of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and Generalized Pareto Distributions (GPD), collectively referred to as extreme value distributions (EVDs), under both stationary and non-stationary assumptions, using frequentist and Bayesian methods. Designed for hydrologists, climate scientists, and engineers, especially those working on extreme rainfall or flood frequency analysis, it supports time-varying covariates, MCMC samplings (Metropolis hasting-Randomwalk, Adjusted Langevin Algorithm, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) and essential model diagnostics. Although developed for environmental extremes, its features are broadly applicable to financial risk modeling and other domains concerned with rare, high-impact events.

## Features

-   Fits stationary and nonstationary EVDs
-   Supports Frequentist and Bayesian inference
-   Transparent, fully customizable MCMC engine implemented in NumPy
-   Advanced samplers: Metropolis Hasting RandomWalk, Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)
-   Support arbitratry covariates in location, scale and shape parameters
-   Integrated diagnostic tools: trace plots, acceptance rates, and bayesian metrics
-   Visualization tool for posterior summaries
-   Lightweight and minimal dependency, only `numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn`

## Implementation

The core `NonStationaryEVD` class handles parameter parsing, log-likelihood construction, prior specification, and proposal generation. Frequentist estimation uses `scipy.optimize` to minimize the negative log-likelihood, while Bayesian MCMC methods are implemented in `numpy` for transparency and flexibility.

Non-stationarity is controlled via a configuration vector `config = [a, b, c]`, where each entry specifies the number of covariates used to model the location, scale, and shape parameters of the EVD. Entry with a value of `0` implies stationarity, while values `> 0` indicate non-stationary modeling using that many covariates.

In Bayesian estimation, `nsEVDx` can infer prior specifications based on the data and configuration or accept user-defined priors. In the frequentist mode, it can determine suitable parameter bounds automatically. However, user defined priors or bounds are recommended for better convergence and interpretability.
