#129 : Create a "Lino foundation"
=================================

Lino users in Belgium started to think about creating an organization
that would ensure sustainable support and maintenance for Lino.

Concrete short-term needs:

- a wiki for user manuals and other documentation to be maintained by
  community members.
- an issue tracker and project management software for (1) Lino
  developers and (2) end-users

A fundamental long-term need is to have a juristic person who takes
the responsibility of long-term maintenance beyond the lifetime of
individual developers.


Some thoughts:

- There is far more work to do than one person can do.

- A fundamental problem with Lino: it currently has a `bus factor
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor>`_ of 100%.  
  
  This problem will disappear automatically if Lino is good enough and
  if I don't die too quickly, but an organization which engages some
  capable people will probably accelerate the process.

- When more developers are joining the project, we will anyway need
  some kind of organization to manage this community.

- I enjoy to help with managing communities but am not the right
  person to do this "seriously", i.e. investing most of my time. I
  prefer to work on Lino rather than to write about it.
