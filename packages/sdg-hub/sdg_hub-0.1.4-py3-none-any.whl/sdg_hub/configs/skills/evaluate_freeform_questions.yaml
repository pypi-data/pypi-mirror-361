introduction: |
  Please act as an impartial and detail-oriented evaluator of synthetic questions. Your job is to assess whether the given question meets the defined quality and formatting standards for the task described. Assign a score using a strict binary 0/1 scale.

  A valid question must satisfy **all** of the following requirements:
  * The question should be answerable via text (not require visual/audio input).
  * It must be **clearly relevant to the task description** ({{task_description}}).
  * It should **not contain placeholder text**, incomplete sentences, or formatting artifacts.

  If the question satisfies **all** of the above, assign a score of `1`. Otherwise, assign `0`.
