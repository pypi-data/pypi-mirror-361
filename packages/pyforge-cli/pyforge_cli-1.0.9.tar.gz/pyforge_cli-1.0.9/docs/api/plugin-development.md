# Plugin Development

*This section is under development.*

PyForge CLI supports a plugin architecture for extending conversion capabilities with custom formats.

## Coming Soon

Plugin development documentation will be available in a future release, including:

- Plugin API specification
- Custom converter development
- Plugin packaging and distribution
- Integration examples

## Current Status

The plugin system is being designed and will be available in a future version.

For now, you can:
- Use existing converters for PDF, Excel, MDB/ACCDB, and DBF files
- Request new format support via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Py-Forge-Cli/PyForge-CLI/issues)

## Next Steps

- [Converters](../converters/index.md) - Available conversion formats
- [CLI Reference](../reference/cli-reference.md) - Command documentation
- [Contributing](../about/contributing.md) - How to contribute to PyForge CLI
