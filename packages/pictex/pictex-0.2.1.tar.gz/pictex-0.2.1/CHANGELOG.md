## [0.2.1] - 2025-07-10

### Features

-   **Configurable Font Smoothing:** Added a `.font_smoothing()` method to the `Canvas` to control the text anti-aliasing strategy. This allows users to choose between `'subpixel'` (default, for maximum sharpness on LCDs) and `'standard'` (grayscale, for universal compatibility).

### Fixes

-   **Text Rendering Quality:** Resolved a major issue where text could appear aliased or pixelated. The new default font smoothing (`'subpixel'`) ensures crisp, high-quality text output out-of-the-box.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-10

### Features

-   **Font Fallback System:** Implemented a robust font fallback mechanism. `pictex` now automatically finds a suitable font for characters not present in the primary font, including emojis and special symbols. A `canvas.font_fallbacks()` method was added for user-defined fallbacks.

### Refactor

-   **Modular Renderer:** The monolithic `SkiaRenderer` has been refactored into a modular `renderer` package. This greatly improves maintainability, testability, and code clarity.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-09

-   Initial release.
