#16 [closed] : Lino cannot switch to BSD or LGPL
================================================

This ticket is closed. See :doc:`79`.

Should I change Lino's license from the current GPL to LGPL or even
BSD?  The main reason to do so would be to stop refraining a certain
group of developers from using Lino.

It seems that Lino **cannot** switch to another license then GPLv3 as
long as we use ExtJS and Ext.ensible.  ExtJS and Ext.ensible are
GPLv3, and Lino uses them both.

- Lino generates and serves HTML pages which contain the instruction 
  to include the `*.js` and `*.css` files of these libraries.

- Lino extends Ext classes and overrides Ext functions or methods.
  (See :srcref:`linolib.js </lino/ui/extjs3/linolib.js>`)
  
According to `Sencha's Open Source FAQ 
<http://www.sencha.com/legal/open-source-faq/>`_, 
at least the second point is a "modification", 
and "All modifications of a GPLv3 licensed products are subject 
to the GPL v3 license."

One possibility is to split Lino into a BSD-licensed "kernel" 
which does not provide any ExtJS based front end,
and a GPLv3 licensed extension "Lino+" of this kernel.

Applications could then be proprietary because 
they "modify" only parts of the BSD-licensed *kernel*. 

It's the end-user 
who decides in a local configuration file to use these GPL products
and to install the Lino+ extension, ExtJS and Ext.ensible.

Of course it is possible to write a new user 
interface which does not require any GPLed library.
It is just a question of priorities.
