Watershed Hydrology
=======================

This section provides a brief overview of the features available for watershed hydrology using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).


Class Instance
-----------------------

To begin, instantiate the required classes as follows:


.. code-block:: python

    import GeoAnalyze
    raster = GeoAnalyze.Raster()
    watershed = GeoAnalyze.Watershed()
    stream = GeoAnalyze.Stream()


.. _basin_area_extraction:

Basin Area Extraction
-----------------------

When open-source DEMs are downloaded for a study area, they are typically provided as rectangular raster datasets with a geographic Coordinate Reference System (CRS).
To extract the basin area from the extended DEM, a main outlet point must be specified. However, the :class:`GeoAnalyze.Watershed` class can automatically delineate the basin
by identifying the highest flow accumulation point as the main outlet. Before proceeding, the DEM must be converted to a projected CRS to ensure accurate hydrological computations.

The following code converts the extended DEM to a projected Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and extracts the corresponding basin area, along with a clipped version of the DEM.
The extended dem raster can be accessed from the `data  <https://github.com/debpal/GeoAnalyze/tree/main/tests/data>`_ directory.


.. code-block:: python
    
    # converting geographic CRS to projected CRS 'EPSG:3067'
    raster.crs_reprojection(
        input_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\dem_extended.tif",
        resampling_method='bilinear',
        target_crs='EPSG:3067',
        output_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\dem_extended_EPSG3067.tif",
        nodata=-9999
    )
    
    # extracting basin area and clipped DEM from extended DEM
    watershed.dem_extended_area_to_basin(
        input_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\dem_extended_EPSG3067.tif",
        basin_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\basin.shp",
        output_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\dem_clipped.tif"
    )

The following figure illustrates the basin extracted from the extended DEM based on the output datasets.

.. _delineation_outputs:

Hydrology
-------------
After obtaining the basin area of the DEM, the following code computes hydrological raster files for flow direction, flow accumulation, and slope. Additionally, it generates shapefiles for the stream network, main outlets, subbasins, and drainage points of the subbasins.

For the input variable `outlet_type`, the recommended main outlet type is single, as the multiple option can create more than one main outlet. Since the multiple option was used to derive the basin area from the extended DEM, it would be inconsistent to generate multiple main outlets within the basin area.

For the input variable `tacc_type`, the threshold flow accumulation type percentage considers a percentage value of the maximum flow accumulation, whereas absolute specifies the number of cells. Suppose `tacc_type` is set to 100 for the absolute threshold flow accumulation type, with a pixel resolution of 10 m. The threshold flow accumulation area is calculated as :math:`100 \times 10 \times 10 = 10000 \text{ m}^2`.


.. code-block:: python

    # DEM delineation
    watershed.dem_delineation(
        dem_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\dem_clipped.tif",
        outlet_type='single',
        tacc_type='percentage',
        tacc_value=1,
        folder_path=r"C:\users\username\folder"
    )

The following figure illustrates the flow direction, flow accumulation, stream network, and subbasins delived from the output datasets.

Adjacent Connectivity
----------------------------------
Adjacent connectivity identifies the next connected segment identifiers for each stream segment in the stream network.
The stream shapefile obtained in the previous section includes a column named `flw_id`, which contains a unique identifier for each stream segment.
Using this file, the adjacent connectivty can be predicted by the follwoing code:


.. code-block:: python

    # adjacent downstream segment identifier
    stream.connectivity_adjacent_downstream_segment(
        input_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        stream_col='flw_id',
        output_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_adjacent_ds_id.shp"
    )
    # adjacent downstream segment identifier
    stream.connectivity_adjacent_upstream_segment(
        stream_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        stream_col='flw_id',
        csv_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_adjacent_us_id.csv"
    )
    
    
    
Total Connectivity
------------------------
Total connectivity returns dictionaries where the keys are stream segment identifiers and
the values are lists representing the complete connectivity structure in the stream network.
The two functions below provide connectivity in both directions: from upstream to downstream up to an outlet point,
and from downstream to upstream until reaching a headwater segment.

.. code-block:: python

    # upstream to downstream total connectivity
    stream.connectivity_upstream_to_downstream(
        stream_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        stream_col='flw_id',
        json_filer"C:\users\username\folder\stream_connectivity_upstream_to_downstream.json"
    )

    # downstream to upstream total connectivity
    stream.connectivity_downstream_to_upstream(
        stream_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        stream_col='flw_id',
        json_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_connectivity_downstream_to_upstream.json"
    )
    
    
Remove Connectivity
------------------------
To remove targeted stream segments and their corresponding upstream connections up to the headwaters, use the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    # removing stream segments and their upstream connectivity
    stream.connectivity_remove_to_headwater(
        input_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        stream_col='flw_id',
        remove_segments=[4],
        output_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_connectivity_remove.shp"
    )
    
    
Merge Connectivity
------------------------
The following code merges split stream segments either between two junction points or from a junction point upstream until a headwater is reached.
The merged segment is assigned the identifier of the most downstream segment among those being merged, and the merge information is saved to an output JSON file.

.. code-block:: python

    # merging split stream segments
    stream.connectivity_merge_of_split_segments(
        input_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        stream_col='flw_id',
        output_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_split_segments_merged.shp",
        json_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_split_segments_merged_information.json",
    )
    
    
Junction Points
--------------------
To get the junction points in a stream network, use the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    # junction points
    stream.point_junctions(
        input_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        stream_col='flw_id',
        output_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_junction_points.shp"
    )
    
    
Main Outlet Points
--------------------
To get the main outlet points in a stream network, use the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    # main outlet points
    stream.point_main_outlets(
        input_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        output_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_main_outlets.shp"
    )
    
Headwater Points
--------------------
To extract headwater points, which are the starting points of stream segments with no upstream connections, use the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    # headwater points
    stream.point_headwaters(
        input_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        stream_col='flw_id',
        output_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_headwater_points.shp"
    )
    
    
Stream Order
----------------
To get Strahler and Shreve order of stream segemnets, use the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    # Strahler order
    stream.order_strahler(
        input_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        stream_col='flw_id',
        output_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\strahler_order.shp"
    )
    
    # Shreve order
    stream.order_shreve(
        input_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\stream_lines.shp",
        stream_col='flw_id',
        output_file=r"C:\users\username\folder\shreve_order.shp"
    )
