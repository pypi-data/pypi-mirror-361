# üå±üåç‚ôªÔ∏è EcoJupyter (a [GreenDIGIT](https://greendigit-project.eu/) project)

`EcoJupyter` is an platform-agnostic sustainability assessment tool for AI infrastructures. The current version is focused on Jupyter Notebook.

This code is open-source, so feel free to copy/paste it into your machine. Please, keep in mind that this is still WIP: it works best with [JupyterK8sMonitor](https://github.com/g-uva/JupyterK8sMonitor) infrastructure configuration and scripts. _For more info please contact the main contributor._
