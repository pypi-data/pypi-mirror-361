# VoiceRestore: Flow-Matching Transformers for Speech Recording Quality Restoration

VoiceRestore is a cutting-edge speech restoration model designed to significantly enhance the quality of degraded voice recordings. Leveraging flow-matching transformers, this model excels at addressing a wide range of audio imperfections commonly found in speech, including background noise, reverberation, distortion, and signal loss.

## Latest Releases

* **01/16/2025** - [Version 1.1 of the checkpoint that improves restoration.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uBJNp4mrPJQY9WEaiTI9u09IsRg1lAPR?usp=sharing)

## Example
### Degraded Input: 

![Degraded Input](./imgs/degraded.png "Degraded Input")

Degraded audio (reverberation, distortion, noise, random cut):

**Note**: Adjust your volume before playing the degraded audio sample, as it may contain distortions.

## Key Features

- **Universal Restoration**: The model can handle any level and type of voice recording degradation. Pure magic.  
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface for processing degraded audio files.
- **Pretrained Model**: Includes a 301 million parameter transformer model with pre-trained weights. (Model is still in the process of training, there will be further checkpoint updates)

---
## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/skirdey/voicerestore.git
   cd VoiceRestore
   ```

   if you did not clone with `--recurse-submodules`, you can run:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the [pre-trained model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uBJNp4mrPJQY9WEaiTI9u09IsRg1lAPR?usp=sharing) and place it in the `checkpoints` folder. (Updated 9/29/2024)

4. Run a test restoration:
   ```bash
    python inference_short.py --checkpoint ./checkpoints/voicerestore-1.1.pth --input test_input.wav --output test_output.wav --steps 32 --cfg_strength 0.5
   ```
   This will process `test_input.wav` and save the result as `test_output.wav`.

5. Run a long form restoration, it uses window chunking:
   ```bash
   python inference_long.py --checkpoint ./checkpoints/voicerestore-1.1.pth --input long_audio_file.mp3 --output test_output_long.wav --steps 8 --cfg_strength 0.5 --window_size_sec 10.0 --overlap 0.3
   ```
   This will save the result as `test_output_long.wav`.

## Usage

To restore your own audio files:

```python
from model import OptimizedAudioRestorationModel

model = OptimizedAudioRestorationModel()
restored_audio = model.forward(input_audio, steps=32, cfg_strength=0.5)
```

## Alternative Usage - using Transformers ðŸ¤—
``` bash
!git lfs install
!git clone https://huggingface.co/jadechoghari/VoiceRestore
%cd VoiceRestore
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

``` python
from transformers import AutoModel
# path to the model folder (on colab it's as follows)
checkpoint_path = "/content/VoiceRestore"
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(checkpoint_path, trust_remote_code=True)
model("test_input.wav", "test_output.wav")
```



## Model Details

- **Architecture**: Flow-matching transformer
- **Parameters**: 300M+ parameters
- **Input**: Degraded speech audio (various formats supported)
- **Output**: Restored speech

## Limitations and Future Work

- Current model is optimized for speech; may not perform optimally on music or other audio types.
- Ongoing research to improve performance on extreme degradations.
- Future updates may include real-time processing capabilities.
