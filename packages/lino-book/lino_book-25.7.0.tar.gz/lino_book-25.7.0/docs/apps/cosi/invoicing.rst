Overview
========

The **invoice generator** is is sales.InvoiceItem

>>> rt.models_by_base(rt.models.invoicing.InvoiceGenerator)
[<class 'lino_xl.lib.trading.models.InvoiceItem'>]

We must explain to Lino how a delivery note turns into an invoice  by extending
the models so that they inherit from :class:`InvoiceGenerator
<lino_xl.lib.invoicing.InvoiceGenerator>`.
