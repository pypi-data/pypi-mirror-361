# Base Model Package

The `base` package provides the foundational components for all financial models in the library. It ensures that all models adhere to a common interface and provides reusable tools for parameter validation.

-   **BaseModel**: An abstract base class that defines the required structure and methods for all pricing models.
-   **ParamValidator**: A utility class with static methods for common parameter validation checks.
