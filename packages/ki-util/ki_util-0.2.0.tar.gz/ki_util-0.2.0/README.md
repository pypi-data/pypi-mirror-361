## How to contribute
### Formatting Code
Formatting is automatically done using Ruff. Ruff is a code formatter for Python which has several advantages:
-	Ruff enforces a uniform style across the codebase, making it easier for team members to read and understand each otherâ€™s code.
-	The resulting standardized format reduces code review overhead.
-	It reduces merge conflicts resulting from different styles.
-	Removes the need for a developer to do any formatting.
-	Lastly it can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure code is formatted prior to merge.

### Documentation
Documentation is done using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html).

The [Google style docstring format](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) is used.

To generate the documentation, run the following:
```commandline
C:\Code\ki-utils>sphinx-apidoc -o docs .
C:\Code\ki-utils>cd docs
C:\Code\ki-utils\docs>make html
# or if overwriting old:
C:\Code\ki-utils\docs>make clean html
```
