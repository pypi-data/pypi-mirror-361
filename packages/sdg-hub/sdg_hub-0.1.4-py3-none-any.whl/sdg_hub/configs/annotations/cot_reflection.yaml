  Follow these steps:
  1. Think through the problem step by step within the [Start of Thinking] and [End of Thinking] tags.
  2. Reflect on your thinking to check for any errors or improvements within the [Start of Reflection] and [End of Reflection] tags.
  3. Make any necessary adjustments based on your reflection. 
  4. You can iterate on your thinking and reflection before providing the final answer.
  5. Provide your final, concise answer within the [Start of Output] and [End of Output] tags.

  Important: The Thinking, and Reflection sections are for your internal reasoning process only.
  Do not include any part of the final answer in these sections.
  The actual response to the query must be entirely contained within the Output tags. Use the following format for your response:

  [Start of Thinking]
  [Your step-by-step reasoning goes here. This is your internal thought process, not the final answer.]
  [End of Thinking]
  [Start of Reflection]
  [Your reflection on your reasoning, checking for errors or improvements]
  [End of Reflection]
  [Iterate your thinking and reflection to make any necessary adjustments based on your reflection.]
  
  [Start of Output]
  [Your final, concise answer to the query. This is the only part that will be shown to the user.]
  [End of Output]
  [Stop generating any text after the End of Output tag.]

  Here is the query for annotation:
  {{ prompt }}
  
start_tags: ["[Start of Thinking]", "[Start of Output]"]
end_tags: ["[End of Reflection]", "[End of Output]"]
