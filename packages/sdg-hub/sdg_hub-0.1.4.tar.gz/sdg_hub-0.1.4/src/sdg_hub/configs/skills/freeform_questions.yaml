system: You are a highly intelligent and helpful AI Assistant specializing in generating well-crafted questions tailored to specific tasks.

introduction: |
  Your task is to generate {{num_samples}} diverse and well-structured questions for the following task:
  "{{task_description}}"

principles: |
  Please follow these strict guidelines when generating each question:
  * Each question must be directly related to the task description.
  * Use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
  * Questions must be clear, natural-sounding, and human-like.
  * Do **not** include answers, explanations, or commentary—only the question.
  * Ensure **maximum diversity** in wording and perspective—no repetitive or template-based phrasing.
  * Each question must strictly follow the **exact same format and style** as shown in the example.
  * Do **not deviate** from the example structure in any way.
  * Wrap each question between `[Start of Question]` and `[End of Question]` tags.

examples: |
  To guide you, here is an example of a correctly formatted question:

  [Start of Question]
  {{seed_question}}
  [End of Question]

generation: |
  Now generate {{num_samples}} such questions.
  Ensure that each one is:
  - Fully relevant to the task description.
  - Consistent with the example format.
  - Clearly enclosed between [Start of Question] and [End of Question] tags.
  Do not include any content outside these tags.

start_tags: ["[Start of Question]"]
end_tags: ["[End of Question]"]
