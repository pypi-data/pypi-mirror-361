#120 : Multiple migrations can conflict with each other
=======================================================

.. highlight:: python

For example :meth:`lino_welfare.migrate.migrate_from_1_1_15` and
:meth:`lino_welfare.migrate.migrate_from_1_1_16` conflict with each
other when both are being applied in a single migration.  Because they
both change the same model ('aids.Aid').

This is a fundamental problem with :ref:`dpy`.  

The solution will probably require a syntax change.  These
`create_foo_Bar` functions should be methods rather than functions in
the global namespace.  For example, the python dump (created by
version 1.1.14) contained a file `aids_aid.py` which contained lines
like this::

  loader.save(create_aids_aid(2,date(2014,4,7),date(2014,4,7),date(2014,4,7),None,137,u'20',5,1,None))

This should rather become::

  loader.create_aids_aid(2,date(2014,4,7),date(2014,4,7),date(2014,4,7),None,137,u'20',5,1,None)


Not urgent because I can always write a quick local workaround when it
happens.
