#46 [closed] : multiple `doctemplates` directories
==================================================

:class:`lino.mixins.printable.BuildMethod` should support multiple 
source locations for document templates. 

Until now each new Lino site need to write or get an initial set 
of doctemplates to be installed in a hard-coded location::

  self.templates_dir = os.path.join(settings.LINO.webdav_root,'doctemplates',self.templates_name)
  
At least `Listing.odt` is 
a template that should be maintained by Lino. 
And also for all other templates there should be an out-of-the-box 
default template that can serve as basis for a corresponding 
local template.

Done :blogref:`20110809`.
