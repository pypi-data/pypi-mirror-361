**CocoIndex** is an ultra performant data transformation framework, with its core engine written in Rust. The problem it tries to solve is to make it easy to prepare fresh data for AI - either creating embedding, building knowledge graphs, or performing other data transformations - and take real-time data pipelines beyond traditional SQL.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://cocoindex.io/images/cocoindex-features.png" alt="CocoIndex Features" width="500">
</p>

The philosophy is to have the framework handle the source updates, and having developers only worry about defining a series of data transformation, inspired by spreadsheet.

## Dataflow programming
Unlike a workflow orchestration framework where data is usually opaque, in CocoIndex, data and data operations are first class citizens. CocoIndex follows the idea of [Dataflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) programming model. Each transformation creates a new field solely based on input fields, without hidden states and value mutation. All data before/after each transformation is observable, with lineage out of the box.

**Particularly**, users don't explicitly mutate data by creating, updating and deleting. Rather, they define something like - for a set of source data, this is the transformation or formula. The framework takes care of the data operations such as when to create, update, or delete.

```python
# import
data['content'] = flow_builder.add_source(...)

# transform
data['out'] = data['content']
    .transform(...)
    .transform(...)

# collect data
collector.collect(...)

# export to db, vector db, graph db ...
collector.export(...)
```

## Data Freshness
As a data framework, CocoIndex takes it to the next level on data freshness. **Incremental processing** is one of the core values provided by CocoIndex.

</p>

The frameworks takes care of
- Change data capture.
- Figure out what exactly needs to be updated, and only updating that without having to recompute everything.

This makes it fast to reflect any source updates to the target store. If you have concerns with surfacing stale data to AI agents and are spending lots of efforts working on infra piece to optimize the latency, the framework actually handles it for you.


## Quick Start:
If you're new to CocoIndex, we recommend checking out
- üìñ [Documentation](https://cocoindex.io/docs)
- ‚ö°  [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart)
- üé¨ [Quick Start Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gv5R8nOXsWU?si=9ioeKYkMEnYevTXT)

### Setup

1. Install CocoIndex Python library

```bash
pip install -U cocoindex
```

2. [Install Postgres](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/installation#-install-postgres) if you don't have one. CocoIndex uses it for incremental processing.


### Define data flow

Follow [Quick Start Guide](https://cocoindex.io/docs/getting_started/quickstart) to define your first indexing flow. An example flow looks like:

```python
@cocoindex.flow_def(name="TextEmbedding")
def text_embedding_flow(flow_builder: cocoindex.FlowBuilder, data_scope: cocoindex.DataScope):
    # Add a data source to read files from a directory
    data_scope["documents"] = flow_builder.add_source(cocoindex.sources.LocalFile(path="markdown_files"))

    # Add a collector for data to be exported to the vector index
    doc_embeddings = data_scope.add_collector()

    # Transform data of each document
    with data_scope["documents"].row() as doc:
        # Split the document into chunks, put into `chunks` field
        doc["chunks"] = doc["content"].transform(
            cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(),
            language="markdown", chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=500)

        # Transform data of each chunk
        with doc["chunks"].row() as chunk:
            # Embed the chunk, put into `embedding` field
            chunk["embedding"] = chunk["text"].transform(
                cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
                    model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"))

            # Collect the chunk into the collector.
            doc_embeddings.collect(filename=doc["filename"], location=chunk["location"],
                                   text=chunk["text"], embedding=chunk["embedding"])

    # Export collected data to a vector index.
    doc_embeddings.export(
        "doc_embeddings",
        cocoindex.targets.Postgres(),
        primary_key_fields=["filename", "location"],
        vector_indexes=[
            cocoindex.VectorIndexDef(
                field_name="embedding",
                metric=cocoindex.VectorSimilarityMetric.COSINE_SIMILARITY)])
```

It defines an index flow like this:
