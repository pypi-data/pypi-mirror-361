# forcode

## Description

The `forcode` module is a Python package designed to work with the `forgen` framework. It is structured to be easily installed and used as a command-line tool. This package is in its early stages, with the current version being 0.1.0. It requires Python 3.8 or higher and depends on the `forgen` package version 0.1.4 or newer.

## Installation

To install the `forcode` package, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install forcode
```

This will automatically handle the installation of the required `forgen` package.

## Usage

The `forcode` package provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool. Once installed, you can access the CLI tool using the following command:

```bash
forcode
```

This command will execute the `main` function located in the `forcode.main` module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `forgen` package version 0.1.4 or newer

## Development

This module is set up using `setuptools`, which facilitates the packaging and distribution of Python projects. The `find_packages()` function is used to automatically discover all packages and sub-packages within the project directory.
