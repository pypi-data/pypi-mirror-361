**There's a number of breaking changes in MedCAT v2 compared to v1.**
Details are outlined [here](docs/breaking_changes.md).

MedCAT can be used to extract information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and link it to biomedical ontologies like SNOMED-CT, UMLS, or HPO (and potentially other ontologies).
Original paper for v1 on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01165).

## Available Models

As MedCAT v2 is still in Beta, we do not currently have any models publically available.
You can still use models for v1, however (see the [README](https://github.com/CogStack/cogstack-nlp/blob/main/medcat-v2/README.md) there).
If you wish you can also convert the v1 models into the v2 format (see tutorial (TODO + link)).

- **General \[1. April 2021\]**: MedCAT is upgraded to v1, unforunately this introduces breaking changes with older models (MedCAT v0.4),
  as well as potential problems with all code that used the MedCAT package. MedCAT v0.4 is available on the legacy
  branch and will still be supported until 1. July 2021
  (with respect to potential bug fixes), after it will still be available but not updated anymore.

## Installation

Currently MedCAT v2 is in Beta.
As such, we're not yet pushing to PyPI.
And because of that the current installation command for (only) core MedCAT v2 is:
```
pip install "medcat @ git+https://github.com/CogStack/cogstack-nlp.git@refs/tags/medcat/v0.10.0#subdirectory=medcat-v2"
```
Do note that **this installs only the core MedCAT v2**.
**It does not necessary dependencies for `spacy`-based tokenizing or MetaCATs or DeID**.
However, all of those are supported as well.
You can install them as follows:
```
pip install "medcat[spacy] @ git+https://github.com/CogStack/cogstack-nlp.git@refs/tags/medcat/v0.10.0#subdirectory=medcat-v2"  # for spacy-based tokenizer
pip install "medcat[meta-cat] @ git+https://github.com/CogStack/cogstack-nlp.git@refs/tags/medcat/v0.10.0#subdirectory=medcat-v2"  # for MetaCAT
pip install "medcat[deid] @ git+https://github.com/CogStack/cogstack-nlp.git@refs/tags/medcat/v0.10.0#subdirectory=medcat-v2"  # for DeID models
pip install "medcat[spacy,meta-cat,deid,rel-cat,dict-ner] @ git+https://github.com/CogStack/cogstack-nlp.git@refs/tags/medcat/v0.10.0#subdirectory=medcat-v2"  # for all of the sbove
```

PS:
For in the above example, we're installing the MedCAT v2 BETA version of `v0.8.0`.
The README is unlikely to change after every new release.
If another version is available / required, substitute the version tag as appropriate.

<!-- 
To install the latest version of MedCAT run the following command:
```
pip install medcat
```
Normal installations of MedCAT will install torch-gpu and all relevant dependancies (such as CUDA). This can require as much as 10 GB more disk space, which isn't required for CPU only usage.

To install the latest version of MedCAT without torch GPU support run the following command:
```
pip install medcat --extra_index_url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/
``` -->
## Demo

The MedCAT v2 demo web app is available [here](https://medcatv2.sites.er.kcl.ac.uk/).

## Tutorials
A guide on how to use MedCAT v2 is available at [MedCATv2 Tutorials](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCATv2tutorials/).
However, the tutorials are a bit of a work in progress at this point in time.
