        A relvar can manage a correlation between tuples in one or two other relvars.

        An association class in Shlaer-Mellor xUML is represented by such a relvar correlation.

        The referential correlation is between a correlation relvar and two other relvars A and B.

        Correlations declare that every tuple in the correlation relvar refers to exactly one tuple of
        relvar A and exactly one tuple of relvar B. (we use lower case a and b here in the code)

        The correlation A attributes refer to an identifier of relvar A and similarly for the B components.

        Multiplicity and conditionality is specified the same as in the create_association command.

        A partition is defined such that the set of tuples in a super relvar is referenced by

        relvar references some tuple in the super relvar and each tuple in the super relvar is
        referenced by one tuple in one of its sub relvars.

        This constraint implies that the tuples in the super relvar are completely partitioned
