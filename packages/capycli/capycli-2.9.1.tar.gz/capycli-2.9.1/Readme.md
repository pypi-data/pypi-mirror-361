Python 3 scripts to allow license clearing automation using the
[SW360](https://github.com/eclipse/sw360) software catalogue.

## What is SW360?

[SW360](https://github.com/eclipse/sw360) is a software component catalogue application designed to
provide a central place for sharing information about software components used by an organization.
It is designed to neatly integrate into existing infrastructures related to the management of
software artifacts and projects by providing separate backend services for distinct tasks and a set
of portlets to access these services. A complete deployment unit exists (vagrant box or docker
container) that contains a complete configuration of all services and portlets.

Companies like Cariad, Siemens or Toshiba use SW360 to track their use of third party software components.

## Why CaPyCli?

SW360 is for software developers and software developers love to automate tasks. The SW360 user
interface is nice if you want to check a project or search for a single component. But if you have
a project with a JavaScript frontend and hundreds of components, you do not want to add all of them
manually. You want to be able to determine your software bill of materials (SBOM) and you want to
map this SBOM to the information that is already available of SW360.

CaPyCli allows you to

* determine your list of dependencies, your software bill of materials (SBOM)
* determine meta-data for the SBOM items and download source files
* map an SBOM to the data available on SW360
* create all missing components and releases
* create a project that contains all releases of your SBOM
* track the progress on license compliance checks
* show information about the project and its releases
* show information about export control information and security vulnerabilities (if tracked via SW360)

```

**Note about `--forceexit` and `--forceerror`**:  
These options are not available for all commands. At the moment

* `--forceexit` applies only to the `project vulnerabilities` command.
* `--forceerror` applies only to the commands `project prerequisites`, `project getlicenseinfo`  
   and `bom show`.

## Use Cases

Over the time we implemented more and more commands with more and more parameters.  
We understand that it is hard for beginners to find the right command for the task
they want to do. Have a look at our [Use Case Overview](UseCaseOverview.md).

## Software Clearing Approaches

From time to time there are questions **why** a command has been implemented in this
specific way or why a command exists at all. Not all organization have the same
approach when doing license compliance. Have a look at our
[Software Clearing Approach Overview](SoftwareClearingApproachOverview.md) to see our
approaches.

## Note about Python Dependency Detection

At the moment there is only support for dependencies defined in a `requirements.txt` file.  
Poetry users can create the `requirements.txt` file via

```sh
poetry export --format requirements.txt -o requirements.txt --without-hashes
```

If you are using pipenv, you can create the `requirements.txt` file via

```sh
pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
```

If your dependencies are defined in `setup.py` you may take a look at
https://dephell.readthedocs.io/cmd-deps-convert.html or
https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools#example-usage-for-pip-compile to generate
a `requirements.txt` file.

Probably the best solution is if you enhance CaPyCli to support poetry, pipenv or setup.py
directly and open a merge request.

## Examples

### Find project by name

Command:

```sh
capycli project find -name "tr-card"
- or -
python -m capycli project find -name tr-card
```

Result

```sh
CaPyCli - Find a project by name

  Searching for projects by name
    TR-Card, 1.0 => ID = ff697cd18fe178b26fc601b60e00fcdf
```

More examples and usage notes can be found in [examples.md](examples.md).

## Prerequisites

* Python 3
* A SW360 read (and write) token, see next section.

## API Access

Access to the SW360 REST API requires an access token.
The token can be requested on SW360/Preferences/REST API Token.

The scripts in this repository expect, that a valid token
is stored in the environment variable ``SW360ProductionToken``.
Alternatively you can specify a token using the `-t` option.

For proper access to an SW360 instance the correct url must be own.
The SW360 url can be specified on the commandline with the `-url`
parameter, via the environment variable ``SW360ServerUrl`` or in the
config file (`.capycli.cfg`).

## SBOM Format

The software bill of materials (SBOM) is a crucial information for most operations.
There is no common description what a bill of materials should contain.
There are different formats available, for example the SBOM of CyCloneDX,
nevertheless most tools have their own SBOM format.
We have decided also to have our own flavor of CycloneDX, see [SBOM](Readme_BOM.md),
focused on the information we need to handle components, releases and projects
on SW360. It is a simple JSON format. CaPyCli reads or writes exactly the
information that is needed.
Conversion support from or to our SBOM format is available.
For converting CycloneDX (XML) to JSON or for converting SPDX SBOMs, we like
to refer you to the open source tools from [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/).

## Mapping a SBOM to SW360

SBOM mapping is described in an extra file, see [SBOM Mapping](Readme_Mapping.md).

## Project Management

This is a Python project managed using ```Poetry```.

## Installation

### From PyPi

* using `pip`:

  ```shell
  pip install capycli
  ```
