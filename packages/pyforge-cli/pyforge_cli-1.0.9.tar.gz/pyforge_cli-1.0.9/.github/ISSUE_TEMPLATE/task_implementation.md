## ⚡ CLAUDE EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Task File Generation
```bash
# Generate structured task list from PRD
"Generate tasks from /tasks/prd-[feature-name].md"

# Start implementation process
"Start working on /tasks/tasks-[feature-name].md"

# Continue execution workflow
"Continue" or "Go" or "Yes" after each task
```

### Implementation Checkpoints
**Phase Gates** (User approval required at each phase):
- [ ] **Analysis Complete**: Codebase analysis and planning approved
- [ ] **Core Feature Complete**: Primary functionality implemented and tested
- [ ] **CLI Integration Complete**: User interface implemented and tested
- [ ] **Testing Complete**: All test scenarios pass
- [ ] **Documentation Complete**: All documentation updated
- [ ] **Ready for Release**: Feature ready for production

### Task Execution Rules
1. **Sequential Execution**: Tasks executed one at a time in priority order
2. **User Approval**: Each completed task requires user approval before proceeding
3. **Checkpoint Reviews**: Major phases require explicit approval to continue
4. **Error Handling**: Failed tasks are re-planned and re-executed
5. **Progress Tracking**: Task status updated in real-time
