June 21th, 2025 - 🚀 Woof-tastic news! Code Puppy now supports **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** for EXTREME PUPPY POWER!!!!.

You can now connect plugins like doc search, Context7 integration, and more by simply dropping their info in your `~/.code_puppy/mcp_servers.json`. I’ll bark at remote docs or wrangle code tools for you—no extra fetches needed.

Setup is easy:
1. Add your MCP config to `~/.code_puppy/mcp_servers.json`.
2. Fire up something like Context7, or any MCP server you want.
3. Ask me to search docs, analyze, and more.

The following example will let code_puppy use Context7! 
Example config (+ more details in the README): 

{
  "mcp_servers": {
     "context7": { 
        "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/sse"
     }
  }
}

I fetch docs and power-ups via those servers. If you break stuff, please file an issue—bonus treat for reproducible bugs! 🦴

This message-of-the-day won’t bug you again unless you run ~motd. Stay fluffy!
