#70 : Lino UI together with Django's permission system
======================================================

Django 1.5 allows for 
`Substituting a custom User model
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/customizing/#auth-custom-user>`__,
but not for substituting the permission system.

See also :doc:`/tutorials/uiless`.

But what if somebody wants a Lino UI together 
with Django's permission system?

The :setting:`django_admin_prefix` setting
doesn't yet work.
It is currently not possible to run `django.contrib.admin` 
on a Lino site because the permission systems aren't compatible.
