    Specific location for os-brick file locks using the ``lock_path``
    configuration option in the ``os_brick`` configuration group.  Previously,
    os-brick used the consuming service's lock_path for its locks, but there
    are some deployment configurations (for example, Nova and Cinder collocated
    on the same host) where this would result in anomalous behavior.  Default
    is to use the consuming service's lock_path.

    This change requires a consuming service to call the ``os_brick.setup``
    method after service configuration options have been called.
upgrade:
  - |
    To use the os-brick specific file lock location introduced in this release,
    an external service using the library must call the ``os_brick.setup``
    method.
