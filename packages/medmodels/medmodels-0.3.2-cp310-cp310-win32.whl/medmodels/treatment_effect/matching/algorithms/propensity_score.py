"""Propensity Score Matching.

This module provides functions for calculating propensity scores and executing
propensity score matching. The propensity score is the probability of being in the
treatment group given a set of covariates. Propensity score matching is a method for
matching treated and control units based on their propensity scores, ensuring that the
two groups are comparable.

    A classification algorithm is trained, and it is used to predict the probability of
    a subject of being either in the treated or in the control set of patients.

    This function supports multiple classification algorithms and allows specifying
    hyperparameters. It is designed for binary classification tasks, focusing on the
    probability of the positive class.

    Args:
        x_train (NDArray[Union[np.int64, np.float64]]): Feature matrix for training.
        y_train (NDArray[Union[np.int64, np.float64]]): Target variable for training.
        treated_test (NDArray[Union[np.int64, np.float64]]): Feature matrix for the
            treated group to predict probabilities.
        control_test (NDArray[Union[np.int64, np.float64]]): Feature matrix for the
            control group to predict probabilities.
        model (Model, optional): Classification algorithm to use. Options: "logit",
            "dec_tree", "forest".
        hyperparameters (Optional[Dict[str, Any]], optional): Manual hyperparameter
            settings. Uses default hyperparameters if None.

            class for treated and control groups.

    Example:
        For "dec_tree" model with iris dataset inputs, returns probabilities of the
        last class for treated and control sets, e.g., ([0.], [0.]).
