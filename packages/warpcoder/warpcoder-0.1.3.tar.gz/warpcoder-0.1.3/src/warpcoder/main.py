# Embedded command content
BDDINIT_CONTENT = '''**BDD INITIALIZATION COMMAND**

Initialize a BDD-driven project with domain models, state diagrams, and minimal feature files.

**ARGUMENTS PARSING:**
Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. `tech_stack` - Technology stack (e.g., python-django, node-express, ruby-rails)
2. `source_folder` - Target directory for the project
3. `app_goal` - One sentence describing the app's purpose

**PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT SETUP**

First, ensure the project structure exists:
- Create the source_folder if it doesn't exist
- Create features/ directory
- Create features/steps/ directory
- Create docs/ directory for documentation
- Create pseudocode/ directory for architecture planning

Based on tech_stack, set up the appropriate BDD framework:

**Python Stack:**
- Check if behave is installed: `pip show behave`
- For Django projects: Install behave-django
- For Flask/FastAPI: Install behave
- Create features/environment.py with basic configuration

**Node.js Stack:**
- Check if cucumber is installed: `npm list cucumber`
- Install @cucumber/cucumber if needed
- Create cucumber.js configuration file

**Ruby Stack:**
- Check if cucumber is installed: `gem list cucumber`
- Install cucumber gem if needed
- Create cucumber.yml configuration

**PHASE 2: GOAL ANALYSIS & APP NAMING**

Analyze the app_goal to extract:
- Core domain entities
- Primary user actions
- Key business processes
- Success criteria

Generate an appropriate app name:
- Extract key concepts from the goal
- Create a memorable, descriptive name
- Ensure it's suitable for the domain

**PHASE 3: DOMAIN-DRIVEN DESIGN DOCUMENT**

Create `docs/ddd.md` with minimal, essential domain model:

```markdown
# Domain Model - [App Name]

## Bounded Context
[Single bounded context for this simple app]

## Aggregates
[List only essential aggregates - usually 1-3 for simple apps]

### [Aggregate Name]
- **Root Entity**: [Entity name]
- **Value Objects**: [List if any, keep minimal]
- **Business Rules**: [Core invariants only]

## Domain Events
[List 2-4 critical events that drive the system]

## Ubiquitous Language
[5-10 key terms max, with clear definitions]
```

Focus on:
- Only entities that directly serve the app goal
- Remove any "nice-to-have" concepts
- Keep relationships simple
- No technical implementation details

**PHASE 4: STATE DIAGRAM GENERATION**

Create `docs/state-diagram.md` with Mermaid stateDiagram:

```markdown
# State Flow - [App Name]

## Business State Diagram

\```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initial
    Initial --> [Core State 1]
    [Core State 1] --> [Core State 2]: [Action]
    [Core State 2] --> [End State]: [Completion]
    [End State] --> [*]
\```

## State Definitions
- **Initial**: [What triggers the process]
- **[Core States]**: [What happens in each state]
- **[End State]**: [Success condition]

## Transitions
[List each transition with business rules]
```

Rules for state diagram:
- Maximum 5-7 states total
- Only happy path transitions
- No error states unless critical
- Clear start and end

**PHASE 5: MISSION DOCUMENT**

Create `docs/mission.md`:

```markdown
# Mission - [App Name]

## Vision
[Elaborate the one-sentence goal into 2-3 paragraphs]

## Success Criteria
1. [Specific, measurable outcome 1]
2. [Specific, measurable outcome 2]
3. [Specific, measurable outcome 3]

## In Scope
- [Core feature 1]
- [Core feature 2]
- [Core feature 3]

## Out of Scope
- [Explicitly excluded feature 1]
- [Explicitly excluded feature 2]
- [Future enhancement 1]

## App Name Rationale
**Chosen Name**: [App Name]
**Reasoning**: [Why this name fits the mission]
```

**PHASE 6: MINIMAL FEATURE FILES**

Create ultra-minimal feature files - first pass:

1. Identify all possible features
2. Reduce to happy paths only
3. Further reduce to critical path only

Final features should be:
- One core workflow feature
- Optional: One setup feature (only if required)
- Maximum 3-5 scenarios total across all features

Example `features/core_workflow.feature`:
```gherkin
Feature: [Core Workflow Name]
  As a [primary user]
  I want to [primary action]
  So that [primary value]

  Scenario: [Single Critical Path]
    Given [minimal precondition]
    When [essential action]
    Then [core success criteria]
```

**PHASE 7: 1990s PSEUDOCODE ARCHITECTURE**

Generate strict procedural pseudocode with:
- Clear BEGIN/END blocks
- Explicit variable declarations
- Simple procedural flow
- No patterns or abstractions

Structure:
```
pseudocode/
├── main_controller.pseudo
├── data_manager.pseudo
├── business_rules.pseudo
└── io_handler.pseudo
```

Example format:
```
PROGRAM MainController
BEGIN
    DECLARE userInput AS STRING
    DECLARE dataStore AS DataManager
    DECLARE result AS BOOLEAN
    
    FUNCTION ProcessRequest(input)
    BEGIN
        VALIDATE input
        IF input IS VALID THEN
            result = dataStore.Save(input)
            RETURN result
        ELSE
            RETURN FALSE
        END IF
    END
    
    // Main execution
    userInput = GetUserInput()
    result = ProcessRequest(userInput)
    DisplayResult(result)
END
```

**PHASE 8: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW & SIMPLIFICATION**

Review all pseudocode and ask:
1. Can any two modules be combined?
2. Is there any unnecessary indirection?
3. Could this be done with fewer files?
4. Would a beginner understand this immediately?

Simplify until the answer to #4 is absolutely YES.

**PHASE 9: SUMMARY GENERATION**

Create `summary.md`:

```markdown
# BDD Project Initialized - [App Name]

## Generated Structure
- ✅ BDD framework configured ([behave/cucumber])
- ✅ Domain model defined (docs/ddd.md)
- ✅ State flow mapped (docs/state-diagram.md)
- ✅ Mission clarified (docs/mission.md)
- ✅ Features created ([list feature files])
- ✅ Architecture planned ([list pseudocode files])

## Quick Start
1. Review the generated documents in docs/
2. Examine the features/ directory
3. Check pseudocode/ for the planned architecture

## Next Steps
Run the bddloop command to:
- Generate step definitions
- Implement the pseudocode as real code
- Make all tests pass

## Configuration
- Tech Stack: [chosen stack]
- BDD Framework: [behave/cucumber]
- App Goal: "[original goal]"
```

**EXECUTION PRINCIPLES:**

1. **Ruthless Simplification**: Always choose the simpler option
2. **No Gold Plating**: Only what directly serves the stated goal
3. **Clear Over Clever**: 1990s clarity beats modern patterns
4. **Test-First Thinking**: Everything prepared for BDD implementation
5. **Single Responsibility**: Each component does ONE thing

Begin by parsing arguments and systematically work through each phase, constantly asking "Can this be simpler?"'''

BDDWARP_CONTENT = '''**BDD WARP COMMAND**

Execute a BDD-driven development loop that continuously runs tests, implements code, and verifies the full application stack.

**ARGUMENTS PARSING:**
Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. `source_folder` - Project directory created by bddinit
2. `iterations` - Number of loops (1-N or "infinite")

**PHASE 1: INITIAL ASSESSMENT**

Navigate to source_folder and verify BDD setup:
- Check for features/ directory with .feature files
- Verify features/steps/ directory exists
- Confirm behave (or cucumber) is installed
- Read docs/mission.md, ddd.md, and state-diagram.md for context
- Examine pseudocode/ for implementation guidance

**CRITICAL: Understand the Mission**
Read mission.md and identify:
- What is the ONE main purpose of this app?
- What is the critical path to achieve that purpose?
- Is this a web app (needs browser) or CLI app (needs menu)?
- What would make the user say "this works!"?

Run initial BDD test suite:
```bash
behave --format progress3 --no-capture
```

Capture and analyze:
- Which steps are undefined
- Which steps fail
- Overall test structure

**FAIL-FIRST PRINCIPLE:**
Remember: We WANT tests to fail initially. This is TDD:
- No mocks or stubs
- No "pass" statements
- Love exceptions and errors
- Each failure guides implementation

**PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION LOOP**

For iteration = 1 to iterations (or infinite):

**Step 1: Run Tests & Capture State**
```bash
behave --format progress3 --no-capture > test_output.txt
```
Parse output to identify:
- Undefined steps needing implementation
- Failing steps needing code
- Passing steps (victory markers)

**Step 2: Generate Step Definitions**
Deploy Sub Agent for undefined steps:
```
TASK: Generate step definitions for BDD tests

CONTEXT:
- Feature file: [content]
- Undefined steps: [list]
- Tech stack: [from bddinit]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create step definition files in features/steps/
2. Each step should RAISE NotImplementedError
3. Include proper behave decorators
4. Match step text exactly
5. Add TODO comments for implementation

DELIVERABLE: Step definition files that fail correctly
```

- UI framework: [JavaScript/etc]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Replace any hardcoded data with API calls
2. Implement real fetch/ajax requests
3. Handle loading states
4. Display real data from backend
5. Ensure error handling

DELIVERABLE: Frontend connected to live API
```

**Step 6: Create User Entry Point**
Deploy Sub Agent for user experience:
```
TASK: Create single-file entry point for users

CONTEXT:
- Mission goal: [from mission.md]
- App type: [web or CLI]
- Tech stack: [from setup]

REQUIREMENTS FOR WEB APPS:
1. Create play.py (or start.py) that:
   - Finds available ports automatically
   - Starts backend API server
   - Serves frontend (if separate)
   - Opens browser to the GAME/APP (not API docs!)
   - Shows "Starting [App Name]..." message
2. Handle Ctrl+C gracefully to stop all services

REQUIREMENTS FOR CLI APPS:
1. Create menu.py using Rich/Textual/Blessed that:
   - Shows beautiful welcome screen
   - Provides numbered menu options
   - Has "1. Quick Start" as first option (no params)
   - Includes help and exit options
   - Uses colors and boxes for visual appeal
2. Make the critical path obvious and immediate

DELIVERABLE: One file that starts everything
```

**Step 7: Integration Testing**
Run full stack test:
```bash
# Use the new entry point
python play.py &  # or menu.py for CLI
APP_PID=$!

# Wait for startup
sleep 3

# Run integration tests
behave --tags=@integration

# Kill app
kill $APP_PID
```

**Step 8: Reality Checks**
Deploy Sub Agent for verification:
```
TASK: Perform user-focused reality verification

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Run the entry point file (play.py/menu.py)
2. Verify it opens to the MAIN PURPOSE immediately
3. For web: Ensure browser opens to game/app (NOT api docs)
4. For CLI: Ensure menu is beautiful and clear
5. Test the critical path as a real user would
6. Verify NO technical barriers between user and goal
7. Check that mission.md goal is achievable in <3 clicks/actions

DELIVERABLE: Reality check report proving user success
```

Deploy Screenshot Sub Agent:
```
TASK: Capture screenshots of running application

CONTEXT:
- App type: [web or CLI]
- Entry point: [play.py or menu.py]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create screenshots/ directory
2. For web apps:
   - Use selenium/playwright headless browser
   - Capture: landing page, main interaction, success state
3. For CLI apps:
   - Capture terminal output as images using available tools
   - Alternative: Save text output to screenshots/cli_output.txt
4. Name files descriptively: 01_landing.png, 02_game_in_progress.png, etc.
5. Include a screenshots/README.md explaining what each image shows

DELIVERABLE: screenshots/ folder with captured images and documentation
```

**Step 9: Test Data Verification**
Create and test with realistic data:
- Generate test_data.json with realistic examples
- Create unit tests for data transformations
- Verify edge cases in data flow
- Test validation at each layer

**Step 10: Documentation & README**
Create user-friendly README.md:
```markdown
# [App Name]

[One sentence description from mission.md]

## Quick Start

```bash
python play.py
```

That's it! The game/app will start automatically.

## What This Does
[2-3 sentences about the main purpose]

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- [Any other requirements]
```

Verify documentation:
- README focuses on USER not developer
- First command is the entry point
- No complex setup instructions
- API docs exist but are secondary

**PHASE 3: LOGGING & EVOLUTION**

**Update droid_log.md:**
```markdown
# Droid Log - Iteration [N]

## Patterns Observed
- [Pattern]: [Description]
- [Challenge]: [How resolved]

## Wild Successes
- [Success]: [What worked well]

## Common Issues
- [Issue]: [Root cause and fix]

## Screenshot Status
- Screenshots captured: [Yes/No]
- Location: screenshots/
- Issues encountered: [Any screenshot setup problems]
```

**Update prompt_evolution.md:**
```markdown
# Prompt Evolution - Iteration [N]

## Improvements for Next Time
- Instead of: "[current approach]"
- Try: "[better approach]"

## Effective Patterns
- "[pattern]" works well for [situation]

## Self-Notes
- [Advice for next iteration]
```

**Step 11: Apply Self-Improvements**
Read prompt_evolution.md and immediately apply suggestions:
- Adjust prompts based on learnings
- Modify approach based on patterns
- Implement suggested improvements
- Focus on user experience improvements

**PHASE 4: LOOP CONTROL**

After each iteration:
1. Check if all tests are passing
2. If yes and iterations != infinite: Complete
3. If no and iterations remaining: Continue
4. If infinite: Continue until context limits

**Progress Tracking:**
```
Iteration [N] of [Total]
- Tests Passing: X/Y
- Coverage: Z%
- Integration: [Status]
```

**PHASE 5: FINAL VERIFICATION**

When all tests pass:
1. Run full test suite one final time
2. Start application and verify manually
3. Document any remaining issues
4. Create summary report

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- All behave tests passing
- Single entry point (play.py/menu.py) works perfectly
- User reaches main goal in <3 actions
- For web: Browser opens to game/app directly
- For CLI: Beautiful menu with quick start
- No technical barriers for users
- README has one simple command to start
- Mission.md goal is immediately achievable

**EXECUTION PRINCIPLES:**

1. **Test-Driven**: Let failing tests drive development
2. **Real Implementation**: No mocks, actual code
3. **Full Stack**: Verify every layer
4. **Continuous Feedback**: Behave is the truth
5. **Self-Improving**: Learn and adapt each iteration
6. **Reality-Based**: Screenshots and manual verification
7. **Data-Centric**: Test actual data flow
8. **Documentation-Aware**: Keep all docs in sync
9. **USER-FIRST**: Always think "How does the user start this?"
10. **CRITICAL PATH**: Focus on mission.md goal above all else

Begin with initial test run and proceed through iterations until success!'''

WarpClaude - BDD Development Tool for Claude Code

Usage:
  python warpclaude.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --menu        Launch interactive menu
  --help        Show this help message
  --check       Check installation status
  (no options)  Auto-setup and run based on project state

Features:
  ✓ Auto-installs Claude Code if missing
  ✓ Sets up Node.js via nvm if needed
  ✓ Configures Context7 MCP for enhanced memory
  ✓ Creates BDD project structure
  ✓ Manages full development lifecycle

Default Behavior:
  - If BDD project exists: Continues with bddwarp (100 iterations)
  - If no project: Starts bddinit (will prompt for details)

Examples:
  python warpclaude.py              # Auto-run based on project state
  python warpclaude.py --menu       # Show interactive menu
  python warpclaude.py --check      # Check installation status
