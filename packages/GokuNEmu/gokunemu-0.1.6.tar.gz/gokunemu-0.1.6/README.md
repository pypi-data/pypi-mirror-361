# GokuNEmu: A Neural Network Emulator Based on the Goku Simulation Suite

GokuNEmu is a neural network (NN) emulator for the nonlinear matter power spectrum, trained on simulations from the Goku suite using the T2N-MusE emulation technique (https://github.com/astro-YYH/T2N-MusE).

For details on the simulations, refer to our paper:

## Installation via pip

```
pip install gokunemu
```

## Usage

A brief example is provided in `speed_benchmark.ipynb`, demonstrating how to use GokuEmu for matter power spectrum predictions.
