`decoupler` is a python package containing different enrichment statistical
methods to extract biologically driven scores
from omics data within a unified framework. This is its faster and memory efficient Python implementation,
a deprecated version in R can be found [here](https://github.com/saezlab/decoupler).

```bash
pip install decoupler
```

2. Install the latest stable full release from [PyPI][pypi] with extra dependancies:

```bash
pip install decoupler[full]
```

3. Install the latest stable version from [conda-forge][conda] using mamba or conda (pay attention to the `-py` suffix at the end):

```bash
mamba create -n=dcp conda-forge::decoupler-py
```

4. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/scverse/decoupler.git@main
