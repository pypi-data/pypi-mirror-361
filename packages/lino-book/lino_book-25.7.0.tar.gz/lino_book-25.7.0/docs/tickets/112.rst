#112 [closed] : Change "PCSW" to "PSWC"
=======================================

Initial observation was that at least the `Public Federal Service for
Integration & Co <http://www.mi-is.be>`_ uses "PSWC" at least on `some
places
<http://www.mi-is.be/en/public-social-welfare-centers/article-60-7>`_.

But there are many other places who use "PCSW".  Personally I'd say
that "Public Centre for Social Welfare" is a more accurate translation
than "Public Social Welfare Centre". Because the *Centre* is public,
not the *Welfare*.  And furthermore it is more easy to pronunciate.

Closed as long as there is no proof of necessity for a change. Lino
says "PCSW", not "PSWC".
