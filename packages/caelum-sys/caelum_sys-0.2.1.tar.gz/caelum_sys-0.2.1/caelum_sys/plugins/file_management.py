File Management Plugin

This plugin provides essential file and directory operations through natural
language commands. It handles creating, deleting, copying, moving files and
directories, as well as listing directory contents.

Commands provided:
- "create file at {path}" - Create an empty file
- "delete file at {path}" - Delete a file  
- "copy file {source} to {destination}" - Copy a file
- "move file {source} to {destination}" - Move/rename a file
- "list files in {directory}" - List directory contents
- "create directory at {path}" - Create a directory

Dependencies:
- os: For file system operations
- shutil: For advanced file operations (copy, move)

Safety Notes:
- Delete operations are permanent and cannot be undone
- Move operations will overwrite existing files at the destination
- All operations respect file system permissions
