# Accuracy

The package provides a simple function to calculate the accuracy rating.

## accuracy(predicted, true)

predicted - a list or numpy vector containing predicted class labels;

true - a list or numpy vector containing real class labels;

Both lists (or vector) have to be of the same length.

The function returns a float value representing the classification accuracy (from 0 do 1).
