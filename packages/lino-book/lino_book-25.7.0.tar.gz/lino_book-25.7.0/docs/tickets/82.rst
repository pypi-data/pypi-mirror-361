#82 : Signed Applet Blocked by Security Settings
================================================

**Status: Solved. Reason was a missing `<security>` tag in the `.jnlp` 
file.** See :blogref:`20131222`

Concretely I ask you: don't try to reproduce it since the environment
is very specific and you don't have a copy of the signed jar files.
Just read the description, look at the source files and the console
log and tell me what you would try in that situation.


I am trying to get :ref:`eidreader` working on an 
**Oracle** Java under **Windows XP**.

I have a local copy of the
`applets <https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader/tree/master/applets>`__
directory (plus all required signed .jar files).

I launch my browser on the `test_using_jnlp.html
<https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader/tree/master/applets/test_using_jnlp.html>`__ file.

The browser refuses to load the applet, displaying the following 
message:

.. image:: /blog/2013/1219c.png

The Java console says:

.. literalinclude:: 82/1221a.log.txt

Tested using **Chrome**,  **Firefox** and **Internet Explorer** 
Chrome and Firefox produce the same message and similar console output. 
II doesn't say anything, no
java console opens, but the applet is not loaded either.

For your convenience 

- The applet has only one source file `EIDReader.java
  <https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader/tree/master/src/eidreader/EIDReader.java>`__
  which defines several classes (because I prefer to have everything
  in one file).

- Here is the `Makefile
  <https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader/tree/master/Makefile>`__ 
  file.


- The `Manifest.txt
  <https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader/tree/master/Manifest.txt>`__ 
  file.

- The `eidreader.jnlp
  <https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader/tree/master/applets/eidreader.jnlp>`__
  file.
