**Advanced Business Logic Exploitation & Exploit Chaining Automation Tool**

LogicPwn is a comprehensive security testing framework designed for advanced business logic exploitation and multi-step attack automation. Built for penetration testing, security research, and automated vulnerability assessment.

## üöÄ Features

- **Advanced Authentication**: Session persistence and multi-step authentication workflows
- **Exploit Chaining**: Orchestrate complex multi-step attack sequences
- **High-Performance Async**: Concurrent request execution with aiohttp
- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible middleware system and plugin support
- **Security Analysis**: Automated vulnerability detection and response analysis
- **Enterprise Logging**: Secure logging with sensitive data redaction
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% test coverage with parameterized tests

## üì¶ Installation

### Basic Installation

```bash
pip install logicpwn
```

### Async Functionality (Recommended)

```bash
pip install logicpwn[async]
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/logicpwn/logicpwn.git
cd logicpwn
poetry install
```

## üéØ Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from logicpwn.core import send_request
from logicpwn.models import RequestResult

# Send a GET request
result = send_request(
    url="https://httpbin.org/get",
    method="GET",
    headers={"User-Agent": "LogicPwn/1.0"}
)

print(f"Status: {result.status_code}")
print(f"Response: {result.body}")
```

### Async Requests

```python
import asyncio
from logicpwn.core import AsyncRequestRunner

async def main():
    async with AsyncRequestRunner() as runner:
        result = await runner.send_request(
            url="https://httpbin.org/get",
            method="GET"
        )
        print(f"Status: {result.status_code}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Exploit Chaining

```python
from logicpwn.core import authenticate_session, AsyncSessionManager

# Authenticate and chain exploits
auth_config = {
    "url": "https://target.com/login",
    "method": "POST",
    "credentials": {"username": "admin", "password": "secret123"}
}

async with AsyncSessionManager(auth_config=auth_config) as session:
    # Step 1: Access admin panel
    admin_result = await session.get("https://target.com/admin/panel")
    
    # Step 2: Extract user data
    users_result = await session.get("https://target.com/api/users")
    
    # Step 3: Execute exploit
    exploit_result = await session.post(
        "https://target.com/api/admin/users",
        json_data={"action": "create", "user": {"role": "admin"}}
    )
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
export LOGICPWN_TIMEOUT=30
export LOGICPWN_MAX_RETRIES=3
export LOGICPWN_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
export LOGICPWN_ENABLE_SESSION_PERSISTENCE=true
```

### Configuration File

```python
from logicpwn.core.config import config

# Set configuration values
config.set_timeout(30)
config.set_max_retries(5)
config.set_log_level("DEBUG")

# Save configuration
config.save()
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Secure Logging

Sensitive data is automatically redacted:

```python
# Password will be redacted in logs
result = send_request(
    url="https://target.com/login",
    method="POST",
    data={"username": "admin", "password": "secret123"}
)
```

### Middleware System

```python
from logicpwn.core import add_middleware, AuthenticationMiddleware, RetryMiddleware

# Add authentication middleware
auth_middleware = AuthenticationMiddleware()
add_middleware(auth_middleware)

# Add retry middleware
retry_middleware = RetryMiddleware(max_retries=3)
add_middleware(retry_middleware)
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=logicpwn

# Run async tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_async_runner.py
```

## üìä Performance

LogicPwn is designed for high-performance security testing:

- **Concurrent Requests**: Handle hundreds of requests simultaneously
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request rate limiting
- **Session Persistence**: Maintain authenticated sessions across requests
