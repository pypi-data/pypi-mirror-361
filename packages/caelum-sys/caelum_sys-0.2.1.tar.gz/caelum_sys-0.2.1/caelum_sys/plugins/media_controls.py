Media Controls Plugin

This plugin provides commands for controlling media playback and system audio.
It uses pyautogui to send keyboard shortcuts that most media players and the
operating system recognize for volume and playback control.

Commands provided:
- "mute volume" - Toggle system volume mute
- "volume up" - Increase system volume  
- "volume down" - Decrease system volume
- "pause music" - Toggle play/pause for media
- "next track" - Skip to next track
- "previous track" - Go to previous track
- "open media player" - Toggle media player (or send play/pause)

Dependencies:
- pyautogui: For sending keyboard shortcuts
- os: For system commands (optional nircmd integration)

Note:
The volume mute function attempts to use 'nircmd' (NirCmd utility) for
additional volume control, but will work with just pyautogui if nircmd
is not installed.

    Toggle play/pause for the currently active media player.
    
    This command sends the "playpause" key which is recognized by most
    media players (Spotify, iTunes, Windows Media Player, VLC, etc.)
    and will toggle between play and pause states.
    
    Returns:
        str: Success message indicating the action was performed

    Toggle system volume mute on/off.
    
    This command attempts two methods for muting volume:
    1. Sends the "volumemute" key via pyautogui (standard approach)
    2. Tries to use nircmd utility for additional control (if available)
    
    The nircmd command is optional and will fail silently if the utility
    is not installed on the system.

        You may see an error about 'nircmd' not being recognized - this is
        normal if you don't have NirCmd installed and doesn't affect the
        primary volume mute functionality.

    Increase the system volume by one step.
    
    Sends the "volumeup" key which is handled by the operating system
    to increase the volume level. The amount of increase depends on
    the system's volume step settings.
    
    Returns:

    the system's volume step settings.
    
    Returns:

    players to advance to the next song/track in the playlist or queue.
    
    Returns:
        str: Success message indicating track was skipped

    Attempt to open or activate a media player.

    of opening the default media player if no player is currently active,
