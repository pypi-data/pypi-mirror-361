"""
Chain of Thought Reasoning Demo for FastADK.

This example demonstrates how to create an agent that shows its reasoning process,
making tool selection and thought process transparent to users.

Usage:
    1. Run this example: `uv run examples/basic/reasoning_demo.py`

No external API keys are required as this example uses the simulated provider.
