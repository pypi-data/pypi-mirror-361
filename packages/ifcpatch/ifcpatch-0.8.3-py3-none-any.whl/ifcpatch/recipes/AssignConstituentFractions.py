class Patcher:
    """
    Assigns fractions to material constituents based on their "width".

    In Reference View MVD, material layer information is exchanged through
    IfcMaterialConstituentSet and IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity instead of IfcMaterialLayerSet.
    The layer thicknesses are stored as IfcQuantityLength within IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity
    with a Discrimination of 'layer'.

    While the Fraction attribute in IfcMaterialConstituent is optional, it's valuable for
    downstream applications as it indicates the relative proportion of each constituent in
    the total material composition in a more straightforward way.
    However, authoring applications often export material constituents without setting this attribute.

    This patcher helps maintain proper material information in Reference View exports by:
    1. Finding width quantities from IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity with 'layer' discrimination
    2. Using these widths to calculate relative proportions
    3. Setting the optional but valuable Fraction attribute

    For example, if a wall has constituents with widths of 0.1m and 0.2m, their fractions
    would be set to 0.333 and 0.667 respectively.
