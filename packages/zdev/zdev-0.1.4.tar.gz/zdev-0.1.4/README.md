# ZDevTools

## Synopsis

This project hosts a versatile collection of Python tools to enable quick & easy algorithmic development. In addition to the underlying ```zdev``` package (see below), a number of extensive tests to show the capabilities as well as some applications making use of the library functions are contained.

## Scripts

All tests are located in the "\test" folder. The majority of these test is "unit test" in nature such that it specifically adresses functions in each module - hence the name structure.

*Note: Some of these functions do also require additional packages such as ```zynamon``` and ```dsap```!*

Besides, some larger demo applications are given in the "\app" folder, e.g. the

- **DataFeeder_GUI**: app for illustrating both static & animated plots
- **DataBroker_GUI**: app to try connections to various databases (e.g. Postgres or InfluxDB)

Furthermore, the BAT-file **auto_deploy.bat** is intended to provide a "single-click" solution for deployment of an operational project from the (development) host to another machine. In this process, a virtual Python environment and all requirements shall be installed in one go.

*Note: All of these scripts are still highly in (ALPHA) state and not yet ready for productive use!*

## Package

The essence of the tools is given by the package **zdev** which is located in the respective subfolder. It contains the following main modules:

- base
- core
- indexing
- parallel
- plot
- testing
- validio
- colors
- searchstr
