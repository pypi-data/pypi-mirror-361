``dashboard`` : customizable dashboard
======================================

.. currentmodule:: lino.modlib.dashboard

The :mod:`lino.modlib.dashboard` plugin adds functionality for letting the users
customize their :term:`dashboard`.

As long as a user didn't populate their dashboard, the list is empty and they
will get all the dashboard items provided by the application.
