# Overview
This package provides interfaces between Python and SAS. This package enables a Python developer to create mixed Python/SAS workflows to leverage the
powers of both SAS and Python, by connecting a Python process to any of a variety of SAS deployments, where it will run SAS code. The SAS code is
generated by the SASPy object and methods or explicitly user written. Results from SAS are returned as text, HTML5 documents (via SAS ODS), or as
Pandas Data Frames. This package supports running analytics and returning the resulting graphics and result data to the Python process. It can convert
data representations between SAS Data Sets and Pandas Data Frames.

This package has multiple access methods which allow it to connect to local or remote Linux SAS, IOM SAS on Windows, Linux (Including Grid Manager),
or MVS, and local PC SAS. It can run within various Notebooks platforms, or IDE's/UI's or in interactive line mode Python or in Python batch scripts.

It is expected that the user community can, and will, contribute enhancements.
