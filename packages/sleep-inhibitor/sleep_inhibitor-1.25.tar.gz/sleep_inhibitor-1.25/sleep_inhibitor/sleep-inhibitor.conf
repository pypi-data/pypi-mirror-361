# Configuration file for sleep-inhibitor program. Copy this to
# /etc/sleep-inhibitor.conf and edit as you want.
#
# Normally the plugin dir (for provided plugins) is automatically
# determined (e.g. at either /usr/share/sleep-inhibitor/plugins or
# /usr/local/share/sleep-inhibitor/plugins) but you can define it
# explicitly here if you want, e.g. for custom config file for testing.
#
# Note period values in this file are specified in minutes by default.
# E.g. "2" is 2 minutes. However, you can append an "s", "m", or "h" to
# specify in seconds, minutes, or hours, e.g. "2s" is 2 seconds, "2m" is
# 2 minutes (i.e. same as "2"), or "2h" is 2 hours.
#
# plugin_dir:
#
# Default global check period in minutes. Can be specified for each
# plugin, or if not specified will be the global default you define
# here, or is 5 mins if not specified at all.
#
# period: 5
#
# Default global check period, while ON/INHIBITING, in minutes. Can be
# specified for each plugin, or if not specified will be the global
# default you define here, or is "period" above if not specified at all.
# Will be limited to "period" value so can not be larger.
#
# period_on:
#
# Default global "what" value. Can be specified for each plugin, or if
# not specified will the global default you define here. Takes a
# colon-separated list of one or more operations to inhibit. See the

# Defaults to the default value of that systemd-inhibit option.
