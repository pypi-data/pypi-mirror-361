        Some software may create an obscene number of styles instead of reusing
        them properly. This patch merges all IfcPresentationStyle,
        IfcSurfaceStyleShading, and IfcColourRgb if they are identical.

        Example:

        .. code:: python

            ifcpatch.execute({"file": model, "recipe": "MergeStyles", "arguments": []})
        """
