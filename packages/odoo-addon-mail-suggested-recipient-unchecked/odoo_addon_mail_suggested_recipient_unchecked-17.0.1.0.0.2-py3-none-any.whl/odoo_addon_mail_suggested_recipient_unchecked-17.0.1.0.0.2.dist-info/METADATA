This module unchecks the extra suggested recipients by default when
going to write a new message in a chatter thread.

Odoo suggests new recipients on several parts of the suite to
accommodate business needs. Example: on CRM opportunities, it proposes
the lead partner to be added to the thread (or to create a partner from
the email if not exists) when the partner is not follower yet. Another
similar example happens with project tasks with a linked customer that
is not yet follower.

3. If the box is checked the email will be sent to the suggested
   recipient.
