# Largefile MCP Server

MCP server for surgical editing of large files with intelligent navigation.

## Status

**This is a placeholder release (v0.0.1) - implementation coming soon!**

## Vision

Enable LLMs to perform surgical operations on files of any size through intelligent navigation, targeted search, and precise editing, eliminating the context barrier that prevents AI tools from working with production codebases.

## Planned Features

- **Surgical Navigation**: Jump to specific lines, functions, or patterns instantly
- **Intelligent Search**: Pattern-based search across files without context limits
- **Precision Editing**: Atomic edit operations that preserve file integrity
- **Context Extraction**: Extract minimal relevant context for LLM consumption
- **Atomic Calculations**: Perform file-wide calculations without full loading

## Installation

```bash
pip install largefile
```

## Usage

```bash
largefile-mcp --host localhost --port 3000
```

## Development Status

This package is in pre-alpha development. The current release is a placeholder to reserve the package name and establish the project structure.
