# Q-CTRL Visualizer

The Q-CTRL Visualizer offers broad functionality to visually engage with quantum dynamics and quantum controls. These tools can help you develop understanding and intuition, and ultimately support the implementation of your quantum controls. See the topic [Visualizing your data using the Q-CTRL Visualizer](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/topics/visualizing-your-data-using-the-q-ctrl-visualizer) in the Q-CTRL documentation for more information.

The Q-CTRL Visualizer is meant to be used with the Q-CTRL products Boulder Opal, Fire Opal, and Open Controls. See how you can get started with [Boulder Opal](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/boulder-opal/get-started) and [Fire Opal](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/fire-opal/get-started) today.
