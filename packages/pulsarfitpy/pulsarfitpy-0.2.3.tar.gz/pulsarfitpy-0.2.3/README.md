# pulsarfitpy
pulsarfitpy is a Python library that uses empirical data from the [Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF)](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/) database & psrqpy to predict pulsar behaviors using provided Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). For more data visualization, it also offers accurate polynomial approximations of visualized datasets from two psrqpy query parameters using scikit-learn.

## Prerequisites:

- Python (>=3.12)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- psrqpy
- scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- SymPy

Install all dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib psrqpy scikit-learn torch sympy
```

## Installation
To install the library, simply run the following in the terminal:
``` bash
pip install pulsarfitpy
```
For library usage, import the pulsarfitpy library with:
```python
