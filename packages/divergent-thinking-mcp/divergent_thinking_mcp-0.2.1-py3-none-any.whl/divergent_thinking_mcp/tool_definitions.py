    description = """A comprehensive tool for generating creative thoughts and breakthrough ideas through structured divergent thinking processes with interactive context specification.

## 1) CONCISE DESCRIPTION
This unified tool provides access to 6 powerful creativity methods through a single interface. It offers both comprehensive multi-turn exploration (structured_process) and quick single-shot creative techniques, with agent-driven context specification for more targeted and relevant creative outputs.

## 2) WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL
- **Primary use:** Complex creative challenges requiring systematic exploration (use structured_process)
- **Quick tasks:** Need rapid creative input or specific creative techniques (use single-shot methods)
- **Problem solving:** Breaking through mental blocks and conventional thinking patterns
- **Innovation:** Developing breakthrough solutions and novel concepts
- **Ideation:** Generating multiple creative directions and alternatives
- **Context-specific creativity:** When you need creativity tailored to specific domains, audiences, or constraints

## 3) KEY FEATURES
- **Required domain specification:** Ensures targeted, relevant creativity by requiring explicit domain selection from 78+ multi-word options
- **Multi-turn structured exploration:** Complete guided creative journey with thought tracking and branching (structured_process - 多轮且结构完整的思考模式)
- **Single-shot quick methods:** Rapid creative techniques for specific needs (单次响应方法)
- **Interactive context specification:** Agent-driven domain, audience, time period, resources, and goals specification for precise targeting
- **Advanced creativity algorithms:** SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, morphological analysis, reverse brainstorming with context awareness
- **Intelligent parameter routing:** Single tool interface with method-specific parameter handling and comprehensive validation
- **Comprehensive coverage:** 6 proven creativity methodologies in one unified interface
- **Adaptive depth:** Adjusts exploration complexity based on problem requirements and context richness

## 4) PARAMETERS EXPLAINED
**Required:**
- `thought`: Your primary idea, problem, or concept to work with (1-5000 characters)
- `thinking_method`: Which creativity technique to apply (default: structured_process)
  - `structured_process`: Multi-turn comprehensive exploration (RECOMMENDED DEFAULT)
  - `generate_branches`: Create 3 different creative directions (single response)
  - `perspective_shift`: View through unusual viewpoints (single response)
  - `creative_constraint`: Apply strategic limitations (single response)
  - `combine_thoughts`: Merge two concepts (single response)
  - `reverse_brainstorming`: Explore failure modes (single response)
- `domain`: **REQUIRED** - Specific field/domain for targeted creativity (must be explicitly specified)
  - Examples: "product design", "mobile app development", "healthcare technology", "sustainable agriculture", "e-commerce", "artificial intelligence", etc.
  - Choose from 78+ available multi-word domain options for precise context

**Interactive Context (Optional):**
- `target_audience`: Who the solution is for (e.g., 'students', 'professionals', 'elderly')
- `time_period`: Time context (e.g., 'current', 'future', '2030s', 'historical')
- `resources`: Available resources/constraints (comma-separated)
- `goals`: Specific objectives (comma-separated)

**Method-Specific:**
- `thought2`: Second concept for combination (required only for combine_thoughts)
- `constraint`: Creative limitation to apply (for creative_constraint, default: "introduce an impossible element")
- `perspective_type`: Viewpoint to adopt (for perspective_shift: inanimate_object, abstract_concept, impossible_being)

**Structured Process Options:**
- `thoughtNumber`: Position in thinking sequence (default: 1)
- `totalThoughts`: Expected total thoughts (default: 3)
- `nextThoughtNeeded`: Continue sequence (default: true)
- `generate_branches`: Create multiple paths (default: false)

**Enhancement Options:**
- `use_advanced_techniques`: Enable SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, etc. (default: false)
- `seed`: Random seed for consistent results (1-999999)

## 5) YOU SHOULD
1. **Always specify a domain** - This is now required for targeted, relevant creativity output
   - Choose the most specific domain that matches your challenge (e.g., "mobile app development" not "software development")
   - Use multi-word domains for precision (e.g., "healthcare technology", "sustainable agriculture")
2. **Start with structured_process** for most creative challenges - it provides the complete multi-turn thinking experience
3. **Use single-shot methods** only when you need quick, specific creative input rather than comprehensive exploration
4. **Provide clear, specific thoughts** as input - the more detailed your thought, the better the creative output
5. **Enhance with context parameters** for even more targeted creativity:
   - Define `target_audience` for user-centered creative solutions
   - Specify `time_period` for temporally-aware creativity
   - List `resources` and `goals` for constraint-aware innovation
5. **Choose appropriate thinking_method** based on your specific creative need:
   - Complex problems → structured_process
   - Quick brainstorming → generate_branches
   - Stuck in conventional thinking → perspective_shift
   - Need breakthrough innovation → creative_constraint
   - Have multiple ideas to merge → combine_thoughts
   - Standard methods not working → reverse_brainstorming
6. **Enable use_advanced_techniques** for more sophisticated creativity algorithms when dealing with complex challenges
7. **Use seed parameter** when you need consistent, reproducible creative outputs across multiple runs
8. **Iterate thoughtfully** - let each creative output inform your next exploration direction
9. **Be specific with context** - the more precise your domain and context parameters, the more targeted and useful the creative output"""
