           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

XnatUtils
=========

Xnat-utils is a collection of scripts for conveniently up/downloading and
listing data on/from XNAT based on the `XnatPy package <https://pypi.org/project/xnat/>`_.

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

The following converters are required for automatic conversions of downloaded images (using the
'--convert_to' and '--converter' options)

* dcm2niix (https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix)
* MRtrix 3 (http://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Installation
------------

Install Python (>=3.4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While many systems (particularly in research contexts) will already have Python 3 installed (note that Python 2
is not sufficient), if your workstation doesn't here are some basic instructions on how to install it.

macOS
^^^^^

macOS ships with it's own, slightly modified, version of Python, which it uses
in some applications/services. For the most part it is okay for general use
but in some cases, such as with `xnat-utils`, the modifications can cause
problems. To avoid these I recommend installing an unmodified version of Python
for use in your scientific programs using Homebrew (http://brew.sh). To do this
first install Homebrew::

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    
then install Python with::

    brew install python3
    
If everything has gone well, when you type::

    which python3
    
it should come back with::

    /usr/local/bin/python3

If it doesn't or your run into any problems follow the instructions you receive
when you run::

    brew doctor

Note that these instructions are just recommendations so you don't have to
follow all of them, just the ones that are likely to be related to your
problem.

Windows
^^^^^^^

Download the version of Python for Windows using the most appropriate installer
for Python (>=3.4), here https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/.
 
Linux/Unix
^^^^^^^^^^

Python3 is most likely already installed but if it isn't it is best to install
it using your package manager.

Install pip
~~~~~~~~~~~

Pip is probably already be installed by default with your Python package so
check whether it is installed first::

    pip3 --version
    
Noting that it should be in /usr/local/bin if you are using Homebrew on macOS.

If pip is not installed you can install it by downloading the following script,
https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and::

    python3 <path-to-downloaded-file>


Install XnatUtils package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The XnatUtils source code can be downloaded (or cloned using git) from
https://github.com/MonashBI/xnatutils.git. To install it
``cd`` to to the directory you have downloaded and run::

    pip3 install xnatutils
    
If you get permission denied errors you may need to use ``sudo``,
or if you don't have admin access then you can install it in your
user directory with the ``--user`` flag.::

    pip3 install --user xnatutils

I have had some difficulty with the installation of ``progressbar2`` as there is a
conflict with the ``progressbar`` package (they both produce packages called
``progressbar``). In this case it is probably a good idea to install xnat-utils
in a virtual environment (https://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Authentication
--------------

The first time you use one of the utilities you will be prompted for the address
of the server would like to connect to, in addition to your username and
password. By default a alias token for these credentials will be stored in
a ~/.netrc file with the following format (with permissions set to 600 on the file)::

    machine <your-server-url>
    user <your-alias-token>
    password <your-alias-secret>

If you don't want these credentials stored, then pass the '--no_netrc'
(or '-n') option.

If you have saved your credentials in the ~/.netrc file, subsequent calls won't require
you to provide the server address or username/password until the token
expires (if you don't want deal with expiring tokens you can just save your username/password
in the ~/.netrc file instead, however, please be careful with important passwords). To reset
the saved credentials provide ``--server`` option again with the full server address
including the protocol (e.g. 'https://') or edit the ~/.netrc file directly.

To connect to an additional XNAT server, provide the new server address via the ``--server`` option.
Credentials for this server will be saved alongside the credentials for your previously saved
servers. If the ``--server`` option is not provided the first server in the file will be used. To
used the save credentials for a secondary server you only need to provide as of the secondary server
address to ``--server`` to distinguish it from the other saved servers. For example given the following
saved credentials in a ~/.netrc file::

    machine xnat.myuni.edu
    user myusername
    password mypassword
    machine xnat-dev.myuni.edu
    user mydevusername
    password mydevpassword
    
then::
    
    $ xnat-ls -s dev MYPROJECT
    
will be enough to select the development server from the saved credentials list.

Usage
-----

Six commands will be installed 

* xnat-get - download scans and resources
* xnat-put - upload scans and resources (requires write privileges to project)
* xnat-ls - list projects/subjects/sessions/scans
* xnat-rename - renames an XNAT session
* xnat-varget - retrieve a metadata field (including "custom variables")
* xnat-varput - set a metadata field (including "custom variables")

Please see the help for each tool by passing it the '-h' or '--help' option.

Help on Regular Expressions
---------------------------

The regular expression syntax used by ``xnat-get`` and ``xnat-ls`` is fully defined
here, https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html. However, for most basic use
cases you will probably only need to use the '.' and '*' operators.

'.' matches any character so the pattern::

   MRH060_00._MR01
   
will match ::

    MRH060_001_MR01
    MRH060_002_MR01
    MRH060_003_MR01
    MRH060_004_MR01
    MRH060_005_MR01
    MRH060_006_MR01
    MRH060_007_MR01
    MRH060_008_MR01
    MRH060_009_MR01

The '*' matches 0 or more repeats of the previous character, which is most
useful in conjunction with the '.' character to match string of wildcard
characters, e.g.::

    MRH060.*
      
will match all subjects/sessions in the MRH060 project.

Note, that when using regular expressions that use '*' on the command line you
will need to enclose them in single quotes to avoid the default wilcard file search, e.g.::

    $ xnat-ls 'MRH099.*'

Probably the only other syntax that will prove useful is the
'(option1|option2|...)'. For example::

    MRH060_00(1|2|3)_MR01
   
will match ::

    MRH060_001_MR01
    MRH060_002_MR01
    MRH060_003_MR01

For more advanced syntax please refer to the numerous tutorials on regular
expressions online.
