description = """
End-to-end GraphRAG toolkit that takes you from raw documents to a knowledge graph and then to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models.

Key features:
• Modular ingestion pipeline: loaders, splitters, and multiple extractors (advanced regex, spaCy/stanza dependency parsing, LLM-based).
• Pluggable graph adapters: in-memory, Neo4j, ArangoDB, TigerGraph, with a clean `BaseGraphAdapter` interface for custom back-ends.
• Indexers & retrievers: Faiss vector index, path / multi-hop graph traversal, hybrid search.
• CLI & Python API: `dgrag ingest`, `dgrag ask`, and fine-grained modules for programmatic use.
• Optional extras keep the core lightweight—install only what you need via `dgraphrag[neo4j,openai]` etc.

Open-sourced by D-Robotics (https://d-robotics.cc/) and maintained by the community. Contributions welcome!
