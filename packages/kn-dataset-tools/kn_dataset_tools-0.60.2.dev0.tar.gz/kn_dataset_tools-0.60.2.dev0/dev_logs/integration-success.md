# Integration Success - 2025-07-05

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing `get_logger` function
- **Problem**: `metadata_engine/engine.py` tried to import `get_logger` from `logger.py` but it didn't exist
- **Solution**: Added `get_logger()` function to `logger.py` that creates child loggers

### 2. Missing `CONFIG_PATH` constant  
- **Problem**: `rule_evaluator.py` tried to import `CONFIG_PATH` from `__init__.py` but it didn't exist
- **Solution**: Added `CONFIG_PATH = Path(__file__).parent / "config"` to `__init__.py`

## Test Results

✅ **Metadata engine successfully imported and initialized**
✅ **Loaded 37 JSON parser definitions**  
✅ **Correctly identified Forge image as "Forge WebUI" instead of "A1111 webUI"**
✅ **Extracted proper Forge version string**: "f2.0.1v1.10.1-previous-659-gc055f2d4, Module 1: xlVAEC_c1"

## Next Steps

The JSON-first parsing system is now working! Test the actual UI application to confirm the integration works in the full application context.

## Integration Flow

1. **New metadata engine loads first** with JSON parsers in priority order
2. **Forge_WebUI.json parser correctly matches** version strings starting with "f"
3. **Falls back to vendored SDPR only if needed** (true JSON-first behavior achieved)

The git reset issue that wiped out the JSON parsers has been resolved by restoring them from backup and fixing the integration.
