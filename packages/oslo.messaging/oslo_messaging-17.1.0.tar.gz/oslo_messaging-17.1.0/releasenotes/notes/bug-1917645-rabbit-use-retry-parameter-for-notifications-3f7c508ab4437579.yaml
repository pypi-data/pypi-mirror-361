    As a fix for `bug 1917645 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1917645>`_ the rabbit
    backend is changed to use the ``[oslo_messaging_notifications]retry``
    parameter when driver tries to connect to the message bus during
    notification sending. Before this fix the rabbit backend retried the
    connection forever blocking the caller thread.
