#145 : Using character types in an `.odt` template
==================================================

I asked for help from the `appy forum
<https://answers.launchpad.net/appy/+question/256313>`_:

    When using the "do text from xhtml()" clause, I want to get
    certain parts of a paragraph in a different font (e.g. Times Roman
    while the default font is Arial).

    The `documentation
    <http://www.appyframework.org/podWritingAdvancedTemplates.html>`_
    says:

    pod uses the styles found in the pod template and tries to make a
    correspondence between style information in the XHTML chunk and
    styles present in the pod template. By default, when pod
    encounters a XHTML element: * it checks if a "class" attribute is
    defined on this element. If yes, and if a style with the same
    "display name" is found in the OpenDocument template, this style
    will be used. The "display name" of an OpenDocument style is the
    name of the style as it appears in OpenOffice, for example;

    Now I tried the following::

      <p class="MyStyle">Foo <font class="VariableText">bar</font></p>

    on a template with a paragraph style named "MyStyle" and a
    Character style named "VariableText".  The paragraph style is
    being applied, but the character style not.

    What am I doing wrong?
