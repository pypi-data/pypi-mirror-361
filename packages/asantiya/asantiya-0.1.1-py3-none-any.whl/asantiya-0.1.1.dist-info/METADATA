# Asantiya â€“ Bringing Ease to Your Deployment Workflow

**Asantiya** (*Pashto: Ø§Ø³Ø§Ù†ØªÛŒØ§*) isn't just a name â€“ it embodies the spirit of the tool. In Pashto:

- **asan (Ø§Ø³Ø§Ù†)** = *easy*  
- **asantiya (Ø§Ø³Ø§Ù†ØªÛŒØ§)** = *ease*, *comfort*, *convenience*

This CLI tool makes deploying applications effortless, whether you're targeting local environments or remote servers.
