"""
This module implements a lightweight, dependency-free fuzzy search
functionality using the `thefuzz` library. It searches against prompt
metadata without requiring a pre-built index.
"""

from thefuzz import process


def search_fuzzy(query: str, prompts: list, limit: int = 10) -> list[dict]:
    """Performs a lightweight fuzzy search on a list of Prompt objects.

    This function works by creating a combined search string from each prompt's
    name, description, and tags. It then uses the `thefuzz` library to find the
    most similar entries to the user's query. This search method is fast and
    does not require a pre-built index.

    Args:
        query: The user's search query string.
        prompts: A list of `Prompt` objects from the SDK.
        limit: The maximum number of results to return.

    Returns:
        A list of result dictionaries, sorted by relevance. Each dictionary
        contains 'score' (0-100), 'name', 'path', 'description', and the
        original 'prompt_object'.
