# Spectral Graph Wavelet Transformation (SGWT)

A Collection of SGWT Functions for Large Sparse Networks

## Introduction

A highly customizable, sparse-friendly SGWT module. Existing GSP tools for the SGWT over sparse networks is limited. This package provides tools to design, approximate, and implement a custom SGWT kernel for use over sparse networks.

The specific implementation is adventagous, as it does not require any modification if the graph itself changes.


No documentation available yet, available soon.

## Installation Notes

More details will be added on specific versions for this python implementation.

- Python 3.8.2
- scikit-sparse
