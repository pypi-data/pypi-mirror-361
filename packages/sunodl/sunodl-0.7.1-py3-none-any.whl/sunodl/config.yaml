# Users shouldn't normally have to mess with the config file. The suno
# endpoint urls are configurable to make it easier to update if they
# move them. Logging is configurable to ease debugging.

endpoints:
  clip: https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/clip/{id}/
  song: https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/clip/{id}/  # sic
  playlist: https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/playlist/{id}/
  mp3: https://cdn1.suno.ai/{id}.mp3

# TODO: It seems less likely that suno would make breaking changes to
# the json structures returned by the endpoints above, but if they do,
# consider making the json -> id3 mapping also configurable. Something
# like this:
#
# id3_data_paths:
#   album: playlist.name
#   cover: playlist.image_url
#   albumartist: playlist.user_display_name
#   tracknumber: playlist.songs.index(song)
#   title: song.title
#   artist: song.display_name
#   date: song.created_at
#   lyrics: song.metadata.prompt
#   illustration: song.image_url
