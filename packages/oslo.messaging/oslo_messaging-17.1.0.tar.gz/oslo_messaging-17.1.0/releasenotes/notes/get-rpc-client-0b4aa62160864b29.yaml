features:
  - |
    Added new ``get_rpc_client`` function to instantiate the RPCClient
    class
deprecations:
  - |
    Instantiating the RPCClient class directly is deprecated in favor
    of using the new ``get_rpc_client`` function to expose a more
    common API similar to existing functions such as ``get_rpc_server``
    and ``get_rpc_transport``
