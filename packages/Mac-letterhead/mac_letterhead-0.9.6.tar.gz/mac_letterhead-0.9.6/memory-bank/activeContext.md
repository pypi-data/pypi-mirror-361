## Recent Changes

### Version 0.9.5 Major Restructuring

1. **Complete Architecture Overhaul**
   - Created modular installation system (`letterhead_pdf/installation/`)
   - Separated components: droplet_builder, resource_manager, applescript_generator, macos_integration, validator
   - Enhanced component isolation for better troubleshooting and maintenance
   - Replaced monolithic installer with clean, testable modules

2. **Smart Margin Detection Algorithm**
   - **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed margin calculation for right-positioned letterheads
   - **Intelligent Position Detection**: Automatically detects left/right/center letterhead positioning

     - Left-positioned: Wider left margin (72pts), minimal right margin (36pts)
     - Right-positioned: Minimal left margin (36pts), wider right margin (72pts)
     - Center-positioned: Symmetric margins for balanced layout
   - **Optimal Layout**: Provides ~82% usable page width regardless of letterhead design
   - **Before/After**: Fixed easy.pdf from -52.4% unusable to +81.8% usable page width

3. **Enhanced Development & Testing**
   - **Development Mode**: `--dev` flag creates local test droplets using development code

   - **Error Recovery**: Better handling of edge cases and errors
   - **Documentation Expansion**: More comprehensive user guides and examples

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Smart Margin Detection Algorithm

**Decision**: Implement intelligent letterhead position detection with adaptive margins.

**Rationale**:
- Previous algorithm incorrectly used header position as margins, causing unusable layouts
- Different letterhead designs require different margin strategies
- Users need consistent, professional document layout regardless of letterhead style

**Implementation**:
- Analyze letterhead position using page center thresholds
- Left-positioned: Wider left margin to avoid logo, minimal right margin
- Right-positioned: Minimal left margin, wider right margin to avoid logo
- Center-positioned: Symmetric margins for balanced appearance
- Provide ~82% usable page width across all letterhead designs

### 2. Modular Architecture Design

**Decision**: Complete restructuring of installation system into discrete, testable modules.

**Rationale**:
- Monolithic installer was difficult to debug and maintain
- Better component separation enables targeted troubleshooting
- Modular design supports different deployment scenarios (development vs production)

**Implementation**:
- `droplet_builder.py`: Core droplet creation logic
- `resource_manager.py`: File and resource handling
- `applescript_generator.py`: Template processing and customization
- `macos_integration.py`: Platform-specific operations
- `validator.py`: Input validation and error handling
- Separate production/development AppleScript templates

### 3. Development vs Production Modes

**Decision**: Support both local development testing and production installations.

**Rationale**:
- Developers need to test changes without affecting production installations
- Different deployment scenarios require different configurations
- Enhanced debugging capabilities improve development workflow

**Implementation**:
- `--dev` flag creates droplets using local development code
- Production mode uses uvx-installed packages
- Separate template files for different execution contexts
- Enhanced logging and diagnostic capabilities in development mode

### 4. uvx Environment Compatibility

**Decision**: Ensure robust operation in uvx isolated environments.

**Rationale**:
- uvx provides user-friendly installation but creates isolated environments
- Library path issues can prevent WeasyPrint from functioning
- Need reliable fallback mechanisms for different system configurations

**Implementation**:
- Internal library path configuration before WeasyPrint imports
- Enhanced environment detection and adaptation
- Improved error handling and fallback to ReportLab
- Clear documentation of system dependencies and troubleshooting steps

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Architecture Principles

- **Modular Design**: Discrete, testable components with single responsibilities
- **Clear Separation**: Distinct boundaries between installation, processing, and UI logic
- **Smart Defaults**: Intelligent behavior that works well without configuration
- **Graceful Degradation**: Robust fallback mechanisms for different environments

### Algorithm Design

- **Position-Aware Processing**: Letterhead analysis drives margin calculation
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Different strategies for different letterhead types
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Threshold-based detection using geometric analysis
- **Optimization Focus**: Maximize usable content area while avoiding letterhead overlap

### Development Standards

- **Local Testing**: Development mode for safe testing without affecting production
- **Component Isolation**: Each module can be tested and debugged independently
- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Comprehensive logging and error reporting
- **Version Consistency**: Single source of truth for version management

### User Experience Principles

- **Invisible Intelligence**: Smart behavior that doesn't require user configuration
- **Consistent Results**: Reliable, professional output regardless of letterhead design
- **Clear Feedback**: Informative messages and troubleshooting guidance
- **Flexible Installation**: Support for both simple and advanced use cases
