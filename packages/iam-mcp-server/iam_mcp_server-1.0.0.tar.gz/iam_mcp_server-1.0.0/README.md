# IAM MCP SERVER ... kind of 🤔

Individual Applicant Mesh MCP Server, server for processing and managing applicant resumes, and search for jobs. This server provides tools and prompts for job search, resume aggregation, job-specific resume, and cover letter, generation.</br>
Indeed, is not really solving any integration but providing specific functionaliy for a MCP host, therefore, the `kinf of 🤔`.

## 📝 Requirements

1. 🗂️ The MCP host must have read and write access to the local file system where it is running. For example, you can run the `IAM MCP Server` within `Claude Desktop`, alongside the `filesystem` MCP Server, which provides this capability. This file access requirement applies to version `1.0` and is necessary for proper operation.

2. 🔍 The `search job` MCP tool requires access to [JSearch](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/JSearch). You can create an account and get 200 requests per month for free.

## ✨ Features

### Prompts

#### 📊 Analyze Job Market

Directs the LLM step-by-step to perform tasks such as conducting a `job search`, then summarizes and analyzes the resulting job listings. Refer to the full prompt for detailed instructions and context.

#### 📄 Resume Mesh

Easily combine multiple targeted resumes into a single, comprehensive Markdown document.

**What is Resume Mesh?**  
If you’ve applied to similar jobs, you’ve likely created several versions of your resume to match different job descriptions. Resume Mesh brings all those versions together into one unified Markdown file. This gives the MCP host a complete view of your experience and makes it easy to generate new, tailored resumes for future applications.

#### 🎯 Job-Specific Resume Generation

Generate customized resumes for individual job postings.

To use this feature, make sure the MCP host already has access to the `resume mesh`. Each tailored resume is generated using both the resume mesh and the specific job description. You need to attach the `resume mesh` to the MCP host conversation in advance, because the resume generation prompt does not instruct the LLM to load the `resume mesh` from the file system.

#### Cover-Letter Generation

Easily generate a customized cover letter tailored to a specific job description, using the corresponding generated resume.

**How to use:**  
Before generating a cover letter, ensure the MCP host has access to the relevant generated `resume` for the target job. You must manually attach this `resume` to the MCP host conversation, as the cover letter prompt does not automatically retrieve it from the file system.

#### 💾 Save Job

Directs the LLM step-by-step to `save jobs`.

**How to use:**

Start by searching for jobs using the `search jobs` MCP tool. After obtaining the results, you can then instruct the LLM to save those job listings.

### Tools

#### 🚀 Search Jobs

Performs a job search using the following parameters:

- role: The job title or position to search for
- city: (optional) Target city for the job search
- country: (optional) Target country for the job search
- platform: (optional) Specific job platform to use
- number of jobs: (default 5) Number of job listings to retrieve
- slice job description: (optional) Option to include only a portion of the job description

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 🖥️ MCP host (Claude Desktop)

1. Locate your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iam": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["mcp-server-iam"],
        "env": {
            "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO",
            "RAPIDAPI_KEY": "<API KEY>",
            "RAPIDAPI_HOST": "jsearch.p.rapidapi.com",
            "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
        }
    }
}
```

or, if you have the source code

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iam": {
      "command": "<path to>/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path to>/iam-mcp-server/src/mcp_server_iam",
        "run",
        "__main__.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO",
        "RAPIDAPI_KEY": "<API KEY>",
        "RAPIDAPI_HOST": "jsearch.p.rapidapi.com",
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Restart your MCP host

- Completely quit and restart your MCP host
- The server will automatically initialize when the host starts

#### Verify the connection

In your MCP host, ask: "What MCP tools are available?" or "List the available MCP servers"

### 🔍 MCP Inspector

In terminal, run `mcp dev src/mcp_server_iam/__main__.py` and accept installing the MCP Inspector.
In the web inspector UI, click `connect` and interact with the MCP server.

⚠️ **Important**, this is for `dev` purposes only.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

IAM supports configuration through environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root or set these variables in your system:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `APP_NAME` | `iam` | Application name for logging and identification |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging level: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL` |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | Application transport version |
| `RESUME_MESH_FILENAME` | `resume_mesh` | Default filename for resume mesh |
| `RAPIDAPI_KEY` | `""` | RapidAPI key for external API access (optional) |
| `RAPIDAPI_HOST` | `jsearch.p.rapidapi.com` | RapidAPI host endpoint |
