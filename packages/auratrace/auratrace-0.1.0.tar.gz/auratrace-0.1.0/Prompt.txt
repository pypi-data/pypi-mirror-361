üöÄ Project Title: AuraTrace ‚Äì AI-Powered Data Lineage & Observability for Python
üî∞ Overview
AuraTrace is a next-generation, lightweight, and intelligent Python package engineered to bring complete transparency to data pipelines. It plugs directly into existing pandas, Dask, and PyArrow workflows, automatically capturing data lineage, profiling transformations, and detecting data quality issues in real-time.

By combining a powerful tracing engine with an AI-powered diagnostic assistant, AuraTrace moves beyond simple reporting to provide actionable insights and root cause analysis. It is designed from the ground up to be "notebook-first," offering a seamless, low-dependency experience that empowers developers to debug, optimize, and trust their data transformations.

AuraTrace is built for the modern data practitioner:

Data Engineers & Scientists: Instantly debug complex joins, filters, and aggregations. Visually trace data from source to sink and understand the performance impact of each step.

Data Analysts: Validate the integrity and quality of datasets within their Jupyter notebooks without needing to learn complex new frameworks.

MLOps & AI Teams: Ensure the data feeding their models is consistent, free of drift, and well-documented, improving model reliability and reproducibility.

Technical Leads & Architects: Gain high-level visibility into pipeline health, data quality trends, and performance bottlenecks across projects.

üß† Key Objectives
Automatic Lineage Tracing: Effortlessly capture a complete, operation-by-operation history of data transformations without requiring manual code instrumentation.

Proactive Data Quality Monitoring: Automatically detect and report on critical data health issues, including schema drift, null violations, distribution shifts, and duplication.

Interactive Debugging & Visualization: Provide an intuitive, interactive Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to visualize the entire pipeline, allowing developers to "click and inspect" any transformation.

Performance & Memory Profiling: Go beyond data quality by tracking execution time and memory usage for each step, pinpointing performance bottlenecks in slow pipelines.

AI-Assisted Root Cause Analysis: Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide natural language explanations for data quality issues (e.g., "Why did nulls spike after this join?") and suggest code fixes.

Notebook-First Simplicity: Offer a frictionless user experience that integrates seamlessly into Jupyter, VS Code notebooks, and standard Python scripts with minimal configuration.

Declarative Quality Checks: Allow users to define data quality expectations and contracts in a simple YAML file, which AuraTrace then automatically validates during pipeline execution.

üß± Core Functional Components
AuraTrace's architecture is designed for modularity and low-dependency operation.

1. Core Tracing Engine (The "Tracer")
This is the heart of AuraTrace. It transparently wraps data manipulation libraries to intercept operations.

Wrapper-Based Interception: Uses lightweight wrappers or "monkey patching" to dynamically extend pandas, Dask, and PyArrow operations (merge, groupby, filter, assign, etc.).

Metadata Capture: For every operation, it records the function called, parameters used, and a unique ID for the input and output dataframes.

Stateful Context: Maintains a session context that tracks the entire sequence of operations for a given script or notebook cell execution.

2. Data Profiling & Schema Engine
At each step, this engine captures a "fingerprint" of the data.

Schema Snapshotting: Records column names, data types, and non-null counts.

Lightweight Statistical Profiling: Calculates essential statistics:

Numerical: Mean, standard deviation, min/max, quartiles.

Categorical: Value counts for the most frequent items, cardinality.

String: Average length, min/max length.

PII Detection (Phase 2): Uses pattern matching (regex) to flag columns that likely contain Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., email, phone numbers, credit card patterns), helping with data governance.

3. Lineage & DAG Engine
This engine constructs the pipeline's structure from the traced metadata.

In-Memory Graph Construction: Builds a graph representation of the pipeline using a lightweight library like networkx or Python's native graphlib. Each node represents a dataframe state, and each edge represents a transformation.

Impact & Causality Analysis: The DAG allows for powerful analysis, such as identifying all downstream steps affected by a change in an upstream column.

4. Drift & Anomaly Detection Engine
This component compares dataframe "fingerprints" across transformations or over time.

Schema Drift: Detects added, removed, or renamed columns, and changes in data types.

Distribution Drift: For advanced use cases, integrates optional statistical tests (scipy) like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to compare the distribution of key columns between runs.

Null & Duplication Monitoring: Tracks the percentage of null values and duplicate rows, flagging significant changes.

5. Performance Analysis Engine
This provides crucial insights into pipeline efficiency.

Execution Time Tracking: Records the wall-clock time for each transformation.

Memory Usage Profiling: Measures the memory footprint of dataframes before and after an operation to identify memory-hungry steps.

Bottleneck Highlighting: Automatically flags the slowest or most memory-intensive operations in the final report.

6. AI Assistant (The "Aura")
This is the intelligent layer that turns data into insights.

LLM Integration: Connects to LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI) or local models (llama.cpp) to power its diagnostics.

Natural Language Querying: Allows users to ask questions about their pipeline in plain English (e.g., auratrace ask "Where did the 'user_id' column get dropped?").

Automated Root Cause Analysis: When a data quality issue is detected, the AI assistant analyzes the lineage to hypothesize the cause (e.g., "Nulls in column_a increased from 0% to 35% after the LEFT JOIN with table_b on a key that has missing values.").

Automated Documentation: Generates markdown documentation for a pipeline, explaining each step, the schema changes, and the final output.

7. Output & Visualization Module
This component presents the collected information in a clear and actionable way.

Interactive HTML Reports: Generates self-contained, interactive DAG visualizations using pyvis, where users can hover over nodes to see schemas and click to get detailed stats.

Rich CLI Output: Uses a library like rich to provide beautiful, color-coded summaries and tables directly in the terminal, including ASCII-based DAGs for a zero-dependency visualization.

Declarative Quality Reports: Provides a clear pass/fail summary based on user-defined quality checks in a quality.yml file.
