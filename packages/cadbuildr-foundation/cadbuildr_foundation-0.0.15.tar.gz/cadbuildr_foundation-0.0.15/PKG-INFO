# Foundation Python lib

Foundation is a python library meant to be used as an API for creating 3D objects. Files using this library can be converted to DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) files which can then be compiled for CAD, analysis, or other purposes.

This is the backbone of [Cadbuildr](https://cadbuildr.com/). See the documentation [here](https://documentation.cadbuildr.com/)
