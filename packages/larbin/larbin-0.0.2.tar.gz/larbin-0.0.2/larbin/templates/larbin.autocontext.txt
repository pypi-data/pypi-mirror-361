You are an AI assistant tasked with solving the following problem: {{ prompt }}. To provide an accurate solution, identify the files you need to see to build the necessary context.

{% if larbin.context.data.get('files', None) %}
These files are already in the context:
{{ prompt2.contents(larbin.context.data.get('files')) }}
{% endif %}

This are the symbols defined in my repository per file:
{{ larbin.repomap() }}

Please:
1. Analyze the task {% if larbin.context.data.get('files', None) %}and provided files{% endif %} and repository symbols map and determine which files are relevant (e.g., source code, configuration files, documentation, logs).
2. Provide only a list of file names or paths, ordered by relevance, with a succint explanation after each file path, one line per path

Example output:
app.py contains something
config.yaml might contain something else ...
