    # - Should process local files synchronously (fast)
    # - Should process HTTP files concurrently
    # - Total time should be dominated by HTTP downloads
    # - Local files should not slow down HTTP downloads

    # Test case 4: Error handling during concurrent downloads
    # - One download fails with real 404, others continue successfully
