# Full-DIA

Full-DIA, a freely available software for single-cell diaPASEF data analysis that 
leverages deep learning to improve proteome coverage, 
quantitative accuracy and analysis speed. Most notably, 
Full-DIA is the first to automatically generate a missing-value-free protein matrix 
under global FDR control, which may offer superior biological interpretability and 
insight into single-cell proteomics data 
compared to conventional matrices with missing values.

### Installation

We recommend using [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to create a Python environment for using Full-DIA, whether on Windows or Linux.

1. Create a Python environment with version 3.9.18.
    ```bash
    conda create -n full_env python=3.9.18 "numpy<2.0.0"
    conda activate full_env
    ```

2. Install the corresponding PyTorch and CuPy packages based on your CUDA version (which can be checked using the `nvidia-smi` command). Full-DIA requires an NVIDIA GPU with more than 10 GB of VRAM, a minimum of 64 GB RAM, and a high-performance Intel CPU.
  - CUDA-12
    ```bash
    pip install torch==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
    pip install cupy-cuda12x==13.3
    conda install cudatoolkit
    ```
  - CUDA-11
    ```bash
    pip install torch==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    pip install cupy-cuda11x==13.3
    conda install cudatoolkit
    ```

3. Install Full-DIA
    ```bash
    pip install full_dia
    ```

### Usage
```bash
full_dia -lib "Absolute path of the spectral library" -ws "Absolute path of the .d folder or a folder containing multiple .d folders"
```
(Please note that the path needs to be enclosed in quotes if running on a Windows platform.)

- `-lib`<br>
This parameter is used to specify the absolute path of the spectral library.
Full-DIA currently supports the spectral library with the suffix .speclib predicted by DIA-NN (v1.9 and v1.9.1) or ***.parquet*** produced by DIA-NN (>= v1.9). 
It supports oxygen modifications on methionine (M) but does not include modifications such as phosphorylation or acetylation. 
Refer to [this](https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN) for instructions on how to generate prediction spectral libraries and convert to .parquet format using DIA-NN. 
Full-DIA will develop its own predictor capable of forecasting the peptide retention time, ion mobility, and fragmentation pattern. 
It may also be compatible with other formats of spectral libraries based on requests.

- `-ws`<br>
This parameter specifies the folder that contains multiple .d directories to be analyzed.

Other optional params are list below by entering `full_dia -h`:
```
       ******************
       * Full-DIA x.y.z *
       ******************
Usage: full_dia -ws WS -lib LIB

optional arguments for users:
  -h, --help           Show this help message and exit.
  -ws WS               Specify the folder that is .d or contains .d files.
  -lib LIB             Specify the absolute path of a .speclib or .parquet spectra library.
  -out_name OUT_NAME   Specify the folder name of outputs. Default: full_dia.
  -gpu_id GPU_ID       Specify the GPU-ID (e.g. 0, 1, 2) which will be used. Default: 0.
```

### Output
Full-DIA will generate **`report.log.txt`** and **`report.parquet`** in output folder. 
The report.parquet contains precursor and protein IDs, as well as plenty of associated information. 
Most column names are consistent with DIA-NN and are self-explanatory.

* **Protein.Group** - inferred proteins. Full-DIA uses [IDPicker](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr070230d) algorithm to infer proteins. 
* **Protein.Ids** - all proteins matched to the precursor in the library.
* **Protein.Names** names (UniProt names) of the proteins in the Protein.Group.
* **PG.Quantity.Raw** raw quantity of the Protein.Group.
* **PG.Quantity.Deep** corrected quantity of the Protein.Group.
* **Precursor.Id** peptide seq + precursor charge.
* **Precursor.Charge** the charge of precursor.
* **Q.Value** run-specific precursor q-value.
* **Global.Q.Value** global precursor q-value.
* **PG.Q.Value** run-specific q-value for the protein group.
* **Global.PG.Q.Value** global q-value for the protein group.
* **Proteotypic** indicates the peptide is specific to a protein.
* **Precursor.Quantity.Raw** raw quantity of the precursor.
* **Precursor.Quantity.Deep** corrected quantity of the precursor.
* **RT** the retention time of the precursor.
* **IM** the ion mobility of the precursor.
