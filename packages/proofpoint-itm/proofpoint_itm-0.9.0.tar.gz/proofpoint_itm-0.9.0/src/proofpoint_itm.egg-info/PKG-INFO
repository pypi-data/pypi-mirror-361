# proofpoint_itm

Proofpoint ITM API client library for python

## Installation

```
python -m pip install proofpoint_itm
```

## Usage

Create a front end script to import the ITMClient class and create a new ITMClient object by passing in the tenant ID (first part of the admin console url), API Client ID, and client secret as a dict.

```python
from proofpoint_itm import ITMClient

itm_client = ITMClient(
    {
        'tenant_id': <tenant id>,
        'client_id': <api client id>,
        'client_secret': <api client secret>
    }
)
```

## Important changes:

v0.9.0 - BREAKING CHANGE: Now uses requests package instead of custom HTTP client. All returns are now python dictionaries instead of urllib response objects. This means that all previous code that used the client will need to be updated to handle the new return types.

v0.8.0 - activity_search() now uses a different backend API call that requires a different search query format. Any previous searches will need to be recreated in the new format. Generate a new exploration and view the query to see the new format.
