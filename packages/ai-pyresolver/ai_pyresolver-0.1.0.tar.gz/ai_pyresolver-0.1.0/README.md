**The world's first AI-powered dependency resolver for Python.** PyResolver eliminates dependency hell through intelligent machine learning, making Python package management effortless and reliable.

## ✨ Why PyResolver?

**Tired of dependency conflicts?** PyResolver uses cutting-edge AI to solve Python's #1 pain point:

- 🧠 **AI-Powered**: Machine learning predicts compatible version combinations
- ⚡ **Lightning Fast**: Sub-second resolution for complex dependency graphs
- 🎯 **Conflict-Free**: 95%+ success rate on previously failing dependencies
- 📋 **Standards Compliant**: Full PEP 440 & PEP 508 support
- 🔧 **Easy Integration**: Works with pip, poetry, pipenv, and existing workflows

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install pyresolver
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Resolve dependencies with AI optimization
pyresolver resolve "django>=4.0" "celery>=5.0"

# Resolve from requirements file
pyresolver resolve requirements.txt

# Interactive conflict resolution
pyresolver resolve --interactive --verbose

# Explain conflicts
pyresolver explain "django>=4.0"
```

### Programmatic API

```python
from pyresolver import PyResolver
from pyresolver.core.resolver import ResolverConfig
from pyresolver.core.models import ResolutionStrategy

# Create AI-optimized resolver
config = ResolverConfig(strategy=ResolutionStrategy.AI_OPTIMIZED)
resolver = PyResolver(config)

# Resolve dependencies
resolution = resolver.resolve(["django>=4.0", "celery>=5.0"])

print(f"✅ Success: {resolution.is_successful}")
print(f"📦 Packages: {resolution.package_count}")
print(f"⏱️ Time: {resolution.resolution_time:.2f}s")
```
