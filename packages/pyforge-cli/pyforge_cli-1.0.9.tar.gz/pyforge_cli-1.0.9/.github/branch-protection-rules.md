# Branch Protection Rules for Main Branch

## Required Settings for `main` branch

### ‚úÖ Protection Rules to Enable:

1. **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ‚úÖ Required approving reviews: 0 (set to 0 to allow self-merge)
   - ‚úÖ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - ‚ùå Require review from CODEOWNERS (uncheck this since you are the codeowner)
   - ‚ùå Restrict reviews (leave unchecked to allow any collaborator to review)
   - ‚ùå Require approval of the most recent reviewable push (uncheck for self-merge)

2. **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Add these status checks (if available):
     - `CI / Test`
     - `CI / Lint`
     - `build`

3. **Require conversation resolution before merging**
   - ‚úÖ Enable this setting

4. **Require signed commits** (Optional but recommended)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable only if all contributors use commit signing

5. **Include administrators**
   - ‚ùå Do NOT check this - allows @sdandey to push directly when needed

6. **Restrict who can push to matching branches**
   - ‚úÖ Enable this setting
   - Add users/teams who can push:
     - @sdandey (repository owner)
   - Leave empty to prevent all direct pushes (even from admins)

7. **Rules for force pushes and deletions**
   - ‚úÖ Allow force pushes - Everyone
   - ‚ùå Specify who can force push: @sdandey only
   - ‚úÖ Allow deletions
   - ‚ùå Restrict deletions to: @sdandey only

## üîß How to Apply These Settings:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Py-Forge-Cli/PyForge-CLI/settings/branches
2. Click "Add rule" or edit existing rule for `main`
3. Apply settings as listed above
4. Click "Create" or "Save changes"

## üö® Important Notes:

- By NOT checking "Include administrators", @sdandey can bypass PR requirements in emergencies
- Setting "Required approving reviews" to 0 allows @sdandey to merge own PRs
- All other contributors MUST create PRs and cannot self-merge
- The CODEOWNERS file ensures @sdandey is notified of all PRs
- Only @sdandey can merge PRs into main (via "Restrict who can push" setting)

## üìä Resulting Workflow:

1. **For @sdandey (Owner)**:
   - Can push directly to main (emergency use only)
   - Can create and merge your own PRs without waiting for approval
   - Still get notified of all PRs from others due to CODEOWNERS
   - Can review and merge other contributors' PRs

2. **For Other Contributors**:
   - Cannot push directly to main
   - Must create PR for all changes
   - Their PRs will notify @sdandey due to CODEOWNERS
   - Cannot merge their own PRs (only @sdandey can merge)
   - Can review PRs but cannot merge without @sdandey approval
