### Strategic Objective

Develop a comprehensive strategy for IMAS prompt engineering that enhances developer productivity while remaining flexible across different MCP client implementations. This work shall establish the framework for guided IMAS interactions without prescribing specific technical implementations.

### Why IMAS-Specific Prompt Engineering Is Required

**The Domain Challenge**: While FastMCP handles natural language to function mapping, IMAS development requires specialized domain knowledge, workflow patterns, and institutional context that generic AI responses cannot provide effectively.

**Generic AI Response** (Current State):

```text
Found: equilibrium.time_slice.profiles_2d.b_field_r contains magnetic field data.
```

**Required IMAS Expert Response** (Strategic Goal):

```text
**Found**: Magnetic field data in equilibrium IDS

**Context**: MHD equilibrium reconstruction using cylindrical coordinates (R, Z, φ)
**Standards**: Follows IMAS Standard Names conventions for magnetic field components
**Access Pattern**: Requires equilibrium reconstruction - not raw diagnostic measurements
**Workflow**: Typically combined with core_profiles pressure data for stability analysis
**Code Example**: Includes proper error handling and coordinate validation
**Version Notes**: DD 3.39.0 coordinate handling, backward compatibility considerations
```

### Prompt Engineering Strategy Development
