## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, and other Debian-based distributions, including older versions).
- **Privileges**: Root access is required for installation and full functionality (e.g., network operations, tool installation).
- **Dependencies**: All necessary external tools and Python libraries are managed and installed by the `install` command.

---

## Installation

1.  Install ADscan using pipx (recommended):

```sh
pipx install adscan
```
Or, using pip:
```sh
pip install adscan
```

After installation, verify that the `adscan` command is available:

```sh
adscan --version
```

Alternatively, download a pre-built binary from the [releases](https://github.com/ADscanPro/adscan/releases) page and place it in your `$PATH`.

2.  **Run the Installer**:
    ```sh
    adscan install
    ```
    This command will:
    - Set up the necessary Python virtual environment.
    - Install all required Python packages.
    - Download and configure external tools and wordlists.

3.  **Verify the Installation**:
    After the installation completes, you can check if all components are set up correctly:
    ```sh
    adscan check
    ```
    This command will perform a series of checks and report the status of dependencies and tools.

## Running ADscan

> **Tip (Optional):** To avoid manually prefixing `sudo`, you can add the following alias to your shell RC (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
>
> ```sh
> alias adscan='sudo -E $(which adscan)'
> ```

1.  **Start the Tool**:
    To launch the interactive shell, run:
    ```sh
    adscan start
    ```

2.  **Verbose Mode (Optional)**:
    For more detailed output during startup and operations, use the `-v` or `--verbose` flag:
    ```sh
    adscan start -v
    # or
    adscan start --verbose
    ```

3.  **The Interactive Prompt**:
    Once started, you will see the ADscan prompt, which includes the current workspace:
    ```sh
    (ADscan:your_workspace) > 
    ```

4.  **Getting Help**:
    - For a list of all command categories:
      ```sh
      (ADscan:your_workspace) > help
      ```
    - For help on a specific category or command:
      ```sh
      (ADscan:your_workspace) > help <category_or_command>
      ```

---

## Basic Usage Example

1.  **Create or Select a Workspace**:
    Organize your audits by creating or selecting a workspace.
    ```sh
    (ADscan) > workspace create my_audit
    (ADscan:my_audit) > 
    ```
    Or select an existing one:
    ```sh
    (ADscan) > workspace select
    # (Follow prompts to choose a workspace)
    ```

2.  **Configure Network Interface**:
    Set the network interface for operations. Your IP will be automatically assigned to the `myip` variable.
    ```sh
    (ADscan:my_audit) > set iface eth0
    ```

3.  **Choose Automation Level**:
    - `set auto True`: More automation, fewer prompts (good for CTFs).
    - `set auto False`: Semi-automatic, more control (recommended for real audits).
    ```sh
    (ADscan:my_audit) > set auto False
    ```

4.  **Perform Scans**:
    - **Unauthenticated Scan** (if you don't have credentials yet):
      ```sh
      (ADscan:my_audit) > set hosts 192.168.1.0/24
      (ADscan:my_audit) > start_unauth
      ```
      Ensure your DNS (`/etc/resolv.conf`) is correctly configured or use `update_resolv_conf <domain> <dc_ip>` within the tool.

    - **Authenticated Scan** (if you have credentials):
      ```sh
      (ADscan:my_audit) > start_auth <domain_name> <username> <password_or_hash>
      ```

5.  **Enumeration and Exploitation**:
    The tool will guide you through enumeration options based on scan results. Specific commands are also available:
    ```sh
    (ADscan:my_audit) > dump_lsa <domain> <user> <password> <host> <islocal>
    (ADscan:my_audit) > kerberoast <domain>
    (ADscan:my_audit) > bloodhound_python <domain>
    ```
    Exploitation actions always require confirmation, even in automatic mode.

## Highlighted Features

- **Automatic/Semi-Automatic Mode**: While `auto=True` speeds up scanning, it is recommended to use `auto=False` for more control in large networks. _Exploitation actions always require confirmation._
- **Data Backup**: Credentials and progress are automatically stored in JSON files within each workspace, making it easier to resume the audit after restarting the tool.
- **Service Detection**: Based on _nmap_, _netexec_, and other utilities, it groups IPs according to detected services (SMB, WinRM, LDAP, etc.) for subsequent exploitation.
