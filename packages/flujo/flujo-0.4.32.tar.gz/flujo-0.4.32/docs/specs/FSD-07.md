### **1. Overview**

This document specifies critical improvements to Flujo's state management and data serialization APIs to improve robustness and developer experience. Currently, initiating resumable pipeline runs is unintuitive, and the state persistence mechanism fails to serialize common application data structures like custom Pydantic models, leading to runtime errors.

This initiative will deliver a more powerful and developer-friendly state management system by implementing three core enhancements:

1. **Introduce a first-class `run_id` parameter** to the `Flujo.run_async()` and `Flujo.run()` methods, creating an explicit and intuitive API for controlling stateful executions.
2. **Enhance Flujo's serialization layer** to automatically handle nested, user-defined Pydantic models and other common Python types (e.g., `datetime`), resolving `TypeError` exceptions during state persistence.
3. **Provide an extensible configuration point** for advanced users to supply custom serialization logic through a global registry.

These changes will address major friction points in the framework, making the creation of durable, long-running agentic workflows significantly more reliable and straightforward for all users.

### **2. Problem Statement**

Developers building stateful applications with Flujo currently face two significant hurdles:

1. **Implicit and Unintuitive `run_id` Management:** To make a pipeline run resumable, a developer must discover and use an implicit convention: passing a `run_id` within the `initial_context_data` dictionary, which then must be correctly mapped to a `run_id` field in a custom `PipelineContext` model. The primary execution methods, `run()` and `run_async()`, offer no direct parameter for this purpose. This lack of an explicit API makes a critical feature difficult to use and prone to implementation errors.
2. **Brittle State Serialization:** Flujo's state backends use enhanced serialization but lack comprehensive handling for custom types. Consequently, when a developer stores a standard application object—like an instance of a custom Pydantic model—in the `PipelineContext` (e.g., in the `scratchpad`), the serialization process may fail with a `TypeError`. This forces developers to manually convert all complex objects to JSON-native types before they can be persisted, adding significant boilerplate and complexity to their application logic.

### **3. Functional Requirements (FR)**

| ID | Requirement | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FR-17 | The `Flujo.run()` and `Flujo.run_async()` methods **SHALL** accept an optional `run_id: str` keyword argument. | Provides an explicit, discoverable API for initiating or resuming workflows. |
| FR-17a | If a `run_id` is provided, the Flujo runner **SHALL** automatically attempt to load and resume the workflow state associated with that ID. | Automates resumable execution. |
| FR-17b | If a `run_id` is provided, it **SHALL** populate the `run_id` field in the `PipelineContext` object at the start of the run. | Simplifies context management. |
| FR-18 | Flujo's `StateBackend` implementations **SHALL** automatically serialize nested, user-defined Pydantic models and other common Python data types when persisting state using the enhanced serialization utilities. | Fixes serialization failures. |
| FR-19 | Flujo **SHALL** provide a global custom serializer registry that allows developers to register custom serialization logic for application-specific types. | Enables extensible serialization. |
| FR-20 | Flujo **SHALL** provide a `safe_serialize` utility function that handles serialization with intelligent fallbacks and error recovery. | Ensures robust serialization. |

### **4. Technical Design**

#### **4.1 Enhanced Serialization Architecture**

The enhanced serialization system will provide:

1. **Global Custom Serializer Registry**: A centralized registry for custom serialization logic
2. **Safe Serialization Utility**: A robust serialization function with intelligent fallbacks
3. **Automatic Type Handling**: Built-in support for common Python types (datetime, complex, sets, etc.)
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes

#### **4.2 API Design**

**Global Registry API:**
```python
from flujo.utils import register_custom_serializer, safe_serialize

# Register custom serializers
register_custom_serializer(MyCustomType, lambda x: x.to_dict())

# Use safe serialization
serialized = safe_serialize(complex_object)
```

**State Backend Integration:**
```python
from flujo.utils import safe_serialize

class CustomBackend(StateBackend):
    async def save_state(self, run_id: str, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        serialized = safe_serialize(state)
        # Storage logic...
```

#### **4.3 Migration Strategy**

1. **Phase 1**: Implement enhanced serialization utilities
2. **Phase 2**: Update state backends to use enhanced serialization
