    Adding support for quorum queues. Quorum queues are enabled if the
    ``rabbit_quorum_queue`` parameter is sets (``x-queue-type: quorum``).
    Setting x-queue-type to quorum means that replicated FIFO queue based on
    the Raft consensus algorithm will be used. It is available as of
    RabbitMQ 3.8.0. The quorum queues are durable by default
    (``amqp_durable_queues``) will be ignored.
    when enabled the HA queues (``rabbit_ha_queues``) aka mirrored queues
    should be disabled since the queue can't be both types at the same time
