    """A composable predicate to build predicates that can use also the previous message.

    This predicate can be used to filter messages based on a custom condition on the
    previous and current messages. This can be useful in cases where you want to
    process messages only if they satisfy a particular condition with respect to the
    previous message.

    Example: Receiving only messages that are different from the previous one.
        ```python
        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast
        from frequenz.channels.experimental import WithPrevious

        channel = Broadcast[int](name="example")
        receiver = channel.new_receiver().filter(WithPrevious(lambda old, new: old != new))
        sender = channel.new_sender()

        # This message will be received as it is the first message.
        await sender.send(1)
        assert await receiver.receive() == 1

        # This message will be skipped as it equals to the previous one.
        await sender.send(1)

        # This message will be received as it is a different from the previous one.
        await sender.send(0)
        assert await receiver.receive() == 0
        ```

    Example: Receiving only messages if they are bigger than the previous one.
        ```python
        from frequenz.channels import Broadcast
        from frequenz.channels.experimental import WithPrevious

        channel = Broadcast[int](name="example")
        receiver = channel.new_receiver().filter(
            WithPrevious(lambda old, new: new > old, first_is_true=False)
        )
        sender = channel.new_sender()

        # This message will skipped as first_is_true is False.
        await sender.send(1)

        # This message will be received as it is bigger than the previous one (1).
        await sender.send(2)
        assert await receiver.receive() == 2

        # This message will be skipped as it is smaller than the previous one (1).
        await sender.send(0)

        # This message will be skipped as it is not bigger than the previous one (0).
        await sender.send(0)

        # This message will be received as it is bigger than the previous one (0).
        await sender.send(1)
        assert await receiver.receive() == 1

        # This message will be received as it is bigger than the previous one (1).
