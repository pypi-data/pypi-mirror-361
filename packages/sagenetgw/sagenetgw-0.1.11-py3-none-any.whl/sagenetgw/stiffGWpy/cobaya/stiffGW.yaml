# The options and parameters defined in this associated yaml file 
# are only recognized by the theory as its class variables/attributes.
# They are loaded automatically with their default values or priors 
# by simply mentioning the theory in the input of the Cobaya run, 
# and will be overridden by redefinitions from the input. 
# Private class attributes that cannot be changed by input parameters should start with an underscore.

### Default options

# Theory or likelihood class options are inherited from any ancestor class .yaml files or class attributes. 
# So there are some user-defined options that are common to all classes 
# and do not need to be specified in the defaults [ClassName].yaml file, e.g., the computational speed 

# Path to local theory code, if desired,
# or 'global' to force global-scope import
path: null
# Speed in evaluations/second
speed: 0.1


### Default values or priors of nuisance parameters of the theoretical model
### Derived parameters are also specified here.
