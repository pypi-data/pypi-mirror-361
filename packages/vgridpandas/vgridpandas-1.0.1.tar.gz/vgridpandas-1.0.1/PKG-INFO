# VgridPandas
Integrates [Vgrid DGGS](https://github.com/opengeoshub/vgrid) with [GeoPandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas) and [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), inspired by [H3-Pandas](https://github.com/DahnJ/H3-Pandas/)

Vgridpandas supports popular geodesic DGGS such as H3, S2, rHEALPix, Open-Eaggr ISEA4T, EASE-DGGS, QTM, and graticule DGGS such as OLC, Geohash, MGRS, GEOREF, Tilecode, Quadkey, Maidenhead, GARS

  ⬢ <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/opengeoshub/vgridpandas/HEAD?filepath=%2Fnotebook%2F00-intro.ipynb">Try it out</a> ⬢
</h3>


## Installation
### pip
[![image](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/vgridpandas.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vgridpandas)
```bash
pip install vgridpandas
```

## Usage examples

### vgridpandas.h3pandas API
`vgiridpandas.h3pandas` automatically applies H3 functions to both Pandas Dataframes and GeoPandas Geodataframes

```python
# Prepare data
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> from vgridpandas import h3pandas
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'lat': [50, 51], 'lon': [14, 15]})
```

```python
>>> resolution = 10
>>> df = df.h3.latlon2h3(resolution)
>>> df

| h3_10           |   lat |   lon |
|:----------------|------:|------:|
| 8a1e30973807fff |    50 |    14 |
| 8a1e2659c2c7fff |    51 |    15 |

>>> df = df.h3.h32geo()
>>> df

| h3_10           |   lat |   lon | geometry        |
|:----------------|------:|------:|:----------------|
| 8a1e30973807fff |    50 |    14 | POLYGON ((...)) |
| 8a1e2659c2c7fff |    51 |    15 | POLYGON ((...)) |
```
