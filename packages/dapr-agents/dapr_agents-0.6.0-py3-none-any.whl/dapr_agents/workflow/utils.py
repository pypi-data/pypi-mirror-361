def get_decorated_methods(instance: Any, attribute_name: str) -> Dict[str, Callable]:
    """
    Find all **public** bound methods on `instance` that carry a given decorator attribute.

    This will:
      1. Inspect the class for functions or methods.
      2. Bind them to the instance (so `self` is applied).
      3. Filter in only those where `hasattr(method, attribute_name) is True`.

    Args:
        instance:  Any object whose methods you want to inspect.
        attribute_name:
            The name of the attribute set by your decorator
            (e.g. "_is_task" or "_is_workflow").

    Returns:
        A dict mapping `method_name` â†’ `bound method`.

    Example:
        >>> class A:
        ...     @task
        ...     def foo(self): ...
        ...
        >>> get_decorated_methods(A(), "_is_task")
        {"foo": <bound method A.foo of <A object ...>>}
