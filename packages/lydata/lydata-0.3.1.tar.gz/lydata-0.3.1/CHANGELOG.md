# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-07-12

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- A superlevel must be unknown, when one sublevel reports "healthy" and the other "unknown". Fixes [#5].

### 🧪 Testing

- Add doc- & unittest for correctly inferring superlevel. Related to [#5].

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-26

Th Python package `lydata` is now pulled out of the data repository [lyDATA](https://github.com/lycosystem/lydata) and will be maintained in the repository [lydata-package](https://github.com/lycosystem/lydata-package).

This required some changes, as the data now cannot be easily shipped with the package. Instead, all data mustalways be fetched from the remote repository.

### 💼 Other

- [**breaking**] Use github by default to fetch datasets
- Fetching from GitHub now works without authentication/token, too

### 🧪 Testing

- Convert examples in `README.md` to valid doctests

### ⚙️ Miscellaneous Tasks

- Run doctest over `README.md` examples during automated tests
- Add build & publish workflows (both PyPI and TestPyPI)

## [0.2.5] - 2025-02-05

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- `get_repo()` did not return repo
- Respect "method" kwarg in combining mods

### 🧪 Testing

- Run `dvc repro` to check new lyscripts

### ⚙️ Miscellaneous Tasks

- Bump requirements

### Change

- Slightly improve logging

## [0.2.4] - 2025-01-15

### 📚 Documentation

- Add `__repr__` & explanation to `C`
- Mention private attribute `_column_map`
- Mention `execute` method of `Q` objects
- Fix unfinished sentence in utils

### Change

- In `__repr__`, add parentheses around combination of `AndQ` and `OrQ`.
- Switch to [`loguru`](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for logging

## [0.2.3] - 2024-12-05

### 🚀 Features

- Add `central` to shortname columns

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- `&` and `|` with `None` return original `Q`. Previously, `Q(...) | None` would return a query that evaluated to `True` everywhere.

### 📚 Documentation

- List defined operators on `Q` (`&`, `|`, `~`, `==`) in the docstring of `CombineQMixin`.

### 🧪 Testing

- ensure that `&` and `|` with `None` return original `Q`.

## [0.2.2] - 2024-12-03

### 🚀 Features

- *(utils)* Add better update func for pandas

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Order of sub-/superlevel inference
- Don't ignore present sub-/superlvl cols

## [0.2.1] - 2024-11-29

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- If an LNL of a patient was unobserved (i.e., all diagnoses `None`), then the method `ly.combine()` returns `None` for that patient's LNL. Fixes [#13]

### 🧪 Testing

- Change the doctest of `ly.combine()` to check whether [#13] was fixed.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-11-14

### 🚀 Features

- Can now combine `Q` with `None` to yield `Q` again.
- Add `contains` operator to `C`, `Q` objects. This calls pandas' `str.contains` method.

### 🧪 Testing

- Fix wrong name in doctests

### Change

- [**breaking**] Add, rename, delete several methods:
  - `LyDatasetConfig` is now just `LyDataset`
  - the `path` property is now `path_on_disk`
  - the `get_url()` method has been removed
  - the `get_description()` method has been removed
  - added `get_content_file()` method to fetch and store remove content
  - `load()` was renamed to `get_dataframe()`
  - the `repo` argument was changed to `repo_name`
- *(utils)* [**breaking**] Rename `enhance` func to `infer_and_combine_levels`.

### Remove

- [**breaking**] Two unused funcs for markdown processing were removed
- *(load)* [**breaking**] Drop `join_datasets`, since it's not needed. All it did was run `pd.concat(...)`.

## [0.1.2] - 2024-10-31

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- *(load)* Fix a bug where datasets with multiple subsites (e.g. `2024-umcg-hypopharynx-larynx`) would cause an error because of a missing `maxsplit=2` argument.

## [0.1.1] - 2024-10-31

### 🚀 Features

- *(load)* add `get_repo()` method that fetches remote repository information for a `LyDatasetConfig
- *(load)* make authentication more flexible
- *(utils)* put sub-/superlevel inference in its own utility function

## [0.1.0] - 2024-10-28

### 🚀 Features

- *(utils)* Add often needed `enhance` function to complete sub-/superlevel involvement and infer maximum likelihood status.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Avoid `KeyError` in `infer_superlevels`

### ⚙️ Miscellaneous Tasks

- Add link to release 0.0.4

### Change

- `infer_su(b|per)levels` skips inferring involvement of sub-/super LNLs that are already present
- *(load)* Rename `skip_disk` to `use_github`
- *(query)* Rename `in_` to `isin` for `C` object

## [0.0.4] - 2024-10-11

### 🚀 Features

- [**breaking**] Make several helper functions private (e.g., `_max_likelihood()`)
- *(utils)* Add more shortname columns, like `surgery` for `("patient", "#", "neck_dissection")`
- *(load)* Allow search for datasets at different locations on disk
- *(query)* Add `C` object for easier `Q` creation
- *(query)* Add `in_` to `C` object
- *(validate)* Add `transform_to_lyprox` function

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- *(load)* Resolve circular import of `_repo`

### 📚 Documentation

- Add intersphinx mapping to pandera
- Expand module docstrings
- Update `README.md` with library examples

### 🧪 Testing

- Fix failure due to changing order of items in set

### Change

- *(validate)* Add args to renamed validation
- Import useful stuff as top-level
- Make `main()` funcs private

### Remove

- *(load)* [**breaking**] `load_dataset()` not needed, one can just use `next(load_datasets())`

## [0.0.3] - 2024-10-01

### 🚀 Features

- Add method to infer sublevel involvement [#2]
- Add method to infer superlevel involvement [#2]
- *(load)* Allow loading from different repository and/or reference (tag, commit, ...) [#4]

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Make `align_diagnoses()` safer
- Make `combine()` method work as intended
- *(load)* Year may be equal to current year, not only smaller
