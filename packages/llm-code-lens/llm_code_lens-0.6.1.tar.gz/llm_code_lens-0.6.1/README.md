## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install llm-code-lens
```

That's it! No complex configuration needed.

---

## üéÆ Usage

### Quick Start
Simply run:
```bash
llmcl
```

This launches the interactive interface where you can navigate your project, select files, and configure analysis options with just a few keystrokes.

### Workflow

1. **Select files**: Navigate your project and choose what to analyze
2. **Configure options**: Set output format, LLM provider, and other settings
3. **Run analysis**: CodeLens examines your code and generates insights
4. **Send to LLM**: With one click, send everything to your preferred AI assistant

### LLM Integration (Enhanced in v0.5.15!)

CodeLens now integrates directly with popular LLM providers:

```bash
llmcl --open-in-llm claude
```

Or select your provider in the interactive menu:
- **Claude**: Optimized format for Anthropic's Claude
- **ChatGPT**: Perfect context for OpenAI's models
- **Gemini**: Formatted for Google's Gemini
- **None**: Skip browser opening

When analysis completes, CodeLens:
1. Opens your chosen LLM in your default browser
2. Copies the complete analysis to your clipboard
3. Provides a system prompt optimized for code understanding

Just paste and start asking questions about your code!

#### New in v0.5.15: Enhanced AI Workflow
CodeLens now provides an optimized workflow for AI code assistance:

1. **System Context**: Automatically includes your OS, Python version, and architecture
2. **Smart Editing**: AI will ask for current files before suggesting changes (ensuring 100% accuracy)
3. **Effortless Updates**: All suggestions use search-and-replace format for quick implementation
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars show exactly what's happening during analysis

The enhanced system prompt ensures AI assistants provide more accurate, contextual suggestions that work perfectly with your specific development environment.

### Interactive Interface

The intuitive terminal interface lets you:
- **See real-time progress** with detailed progress bars and file-by-file indicators
- Navigate with arrow keys (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí)
- **Watch progress in real-time** with animated progress bars and current file indicators
- Select files and directories with Space (includes all sub-elements)
- Switch sections with Tab
- Configure options with function keys (F1-F6)
- Confirm with Enter
- Cancel with Escape or Q

All your settings persist between runs, so you can quickly analyze the same files again.

#### Selection States
- **[+]** - Included file or directory
- **[*]** - Explicitly selected file or directory
- **[-]** - Excluded file or directory

### Command Line Options

For CI/CD pipelines or scripting:

```bash
llmcl --format json --full --open-in-llm claude
```

Full options list:
- `--output/-o`: Output directory (default: .codelens)
- `--format/-f`: Output format (txt or json)
- `--full`: Export complete file contents
- `--debug`: Enable detailed logging
- `--sql-server`: SQL Server connection string
- `--sql-database`: Database to analyze
