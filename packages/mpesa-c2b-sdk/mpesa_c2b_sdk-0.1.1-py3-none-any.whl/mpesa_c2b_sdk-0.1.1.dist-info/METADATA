### MPESA C2B SDK
This SDK is a simplified and improved version of existing Mpesa C2B packages. It helps developers easily integrate with Safaricom's Daraja API, focusing specifically on Customer to Business (C2B) transactions â€” like simulating payments and registering callback URLs.

## Features
1. **Easy URL registration (register_url)**
2. **Simulate C2B transactions (simulate)**
3. **Minimal setup with .env support**

## Installation
```bash
pip install mpesa-c2b-sdk==0.1.0
```
Ideal for developers building Kenyan payment solutions using Safaricom's sandbox or production APIs.
