# Connecpy Examples

## Requirements
You can install requirements for running the examples with executing the following command on the root directory of this repository:
```sh
uv sync
```

## Running server (ASGI)
You can run the Connecpy ASGI application using servers such as uvicorn.
Example uvicorn command : `uv run uvicorn --port 3000 server:app`

## Running server (WSGI)
You can run the Connecpy WSGI application using the following command :
`uv run wsgi_server.py`

## Running client
After server has started, you can make request using the example client with the following command :
`uv run async_client.py` or `uv run client.py`

Example output :
```
size: 12
color: "black"
name: "bowler"
```

## Generated code
The example server and client makes use of code generated by `protoc-gen-connecpy` plugin. You can find the code in `.` folder. To generate the code yourself for `haberdasher`,
ensure you have Go installed and run go run github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf@v1.55.1 generate.

## Making Compressed Requests

After starting the server, you can test compression in several ways:

### Using the Example Client
The example clients demonstrate how to use compression:

```sh
# Async client with Brotli compression
uv run async_client.py

# Sync client with gzip compression
uv run client.py
```

### Using curl
Test different compression methods:

```sh
# POST request with Brotli compression
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Encoding: br" \
  -d '{"inches": 12}' \
  http://localhost:3000/i2y.connecpy.example.Haberdasher/MakeHat

# GET request with gzip compression
curl "http://localhost:3000/i2y.connecpy.example.Haberdasher/MakeHat?compression=gzip&message=eyJpbmNoZXMiOjEyfQ==&base64=1"
```

Note: For GET requests, the message should be base64 encoded when using binary formats like protobuf or compressed data.

# gRPC Examples
Connecpy does not support gRPC. However, you can use the same service code to run a gRPC server and client.
`grpc_server.py` uses the same service code as `server.py`.


## Runnning gRPC server
You can run the gRPC server using the following command :
`uv run grpc_server.py`


## Running gRPC client
After gRPC server has started, you can make request using the example client with the following command :
`uv run grpc_client.py`

## Generated code
`uv run python -m grpc_tools.protoc --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --grpc_python_out=. -I . haberdasher.proto`
  - python_out : The directory where generated Protobuf Python code needs to be saved.
  - pyi_out : The directory where generated Python stub code for Protobuf Messages needs to be saved.
  - grpc_python_out : The directory where generated gRPC Python server and client stub code needs to be saved.
