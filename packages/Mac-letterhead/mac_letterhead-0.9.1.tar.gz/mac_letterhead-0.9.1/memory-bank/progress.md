# Mac-letterhead Progress

## What Works

### PDF Processing

- âœ… Loading and analyzing PDF letterhead templates
- âœ… Detecting letterhead regions to avoid content overlap
- âœ… Merging letterhead with PDF content
- âœ… Multiple merging strategies (darken, multiply, overlay)
- âœ… Multi-page letterhead support (different first/subsequent pages)
- âœ… Preserving PDF metadata and properties
- âœ… Handling various PDF formats and versions

### Markdown Processing

- âœ… Parsing Markdown to HTML
- âœ… WeasyPrint rendering with CSS styling
- âœ… ReportLab fallback rendering
- âœ… Runtime detection of available rendering engines
- âœ… Consistent API regardless of rendering engine
- âœ… Support for common Markdown elements (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.)
- âœ… Basic table support
- âœ… Dynamic Python path management for finding optional modules

### Installation and Packaging

- âœ… Basic installation (PDF-only functionality)
- âœ… Full installation (PDF + Markdown support)
- âœ… Desktop application creation
- âœ… Drag-and-drop functionality
- âœ… Command-line interface
- âœ… Self-contained package with minimal dependencies

### Testing and Documentation

- âœ… Basic test suite for PDF functionality
- âœ… Makefile targets for different test scenarios
- âœ… Dedicated test target for WeasyPrint testing
- âœ… Basic documentation in README
- âœ… Command-line help messages
- âœ… Simple test Markdown file for Markdown testing
- âœ… Test PDF document for basic PDF testing
- âœ… Environment variable configuration for testing

## Current Status

### Version 0.8.0 (In Progress)

The project is currently at version 0.8.0, with the following status:

- **PDF Functionality**: Complete and stable
- **Markdown Functionality**: Implemented with tiered approach
  - WeasyPrint: Primary renderer (requires optional dependencies)
  - ReportLab: Fallback renderer (included in core dependencies)
  - Python path management: Dynamically adds site-packages to sys.path
- **Installation**: Tiered approach implemented
  - Basic: PDF-only functionality
  - Full: PDF + Markdown support
- **Testing**: 
  - Basic tests implemented and passing
  - Full tests implemented with Python 3.11 and passing
  - Issues with Python 3.12 and 3.13 due to PyObjC circular import
- **Documentation**: Basic documentation available, detailed documentation in progress

### Current Focus

The current focus is on finalizing the Markdown processing functionality, ensuring a smooth installation experience for both basic and full installations, and fixing compatibility issues with Python 3.12 and 3.13.

## Known Issues

### WeasyPrint Installation

- **Issue**: WeasyPrint has complex dependencies that can be challenging to install, particularly on macOS
- **Workaround**: 
  - Tiered installation approach with ReportLab fallback
  - Clear documentation of required system dependencies:
    ```
    brew install pango cairo fontconfig freetype harfbuzz
    ```
  - Dedicated test target that checks for WeasyPrint functionality
  - DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to help locate system libraries
  - Always import ReportLab dependencies for consistent behavior
- **Status**: Addressed in version 0.8.0

### ReportLab Rendering Limitations

- **Issue**: ReportLab has limitations in rendering complex Markdown elements
- **Workaround**: Use WeasyPrint for complex documents
- **Status**: Known limitation, documented in warnings

### Desktop Application Platform Limitations

- **Issue**: Desktop application currently only supports macOS
- **Workaround**: Use command-line interface on other platforms
- **Status**: Future enhancement planned

### Python 3.12 and 3.13 Compatibility

- **Issue**: PyObjC has circular import issues with Python 3.12 and 3.13
- **Workaround**: Use Python 3.11 for now
- **Status**: Needs investigation and fix

### Markdown Module Import

- **Issue**: Markdown module not found in virtual environments despite being installed
- **Workaround**: 
  - Dynamically add site-packages to sys.path at runtime
  - Set PYTHONPATH environment variable in test scripts
- **Status**: Fixed in version 0.8.0
