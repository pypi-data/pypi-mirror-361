"""
Demonstrates using a Typed Pipeline Context to share state across steps.

A Typed Context is a Pydantic model that acts as a shared "scratchpad" for
a single pipeline run. It's perfect for passing data between non-adjacent
steps or for accumulating information throughout a workflow.
For more details, see docs/pipeline_context.md.
