Test Environment Simplification

This module tests the environment simplification effort, comparing the
adapter-based implementation with the simplified direct implementation.

Verifies:
1. Functionality is preserved (same behavior)
2. Complexity is reduced (fewer classes, lines of code)
3. Control plane separation still works
4. North star architecture compliance

This addresses the environment simplification requirement from the progress notes.
