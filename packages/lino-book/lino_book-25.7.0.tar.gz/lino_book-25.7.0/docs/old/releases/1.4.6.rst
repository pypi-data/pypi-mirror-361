Version 1.4.6 (20120717)
========================

:checkin:`92598a80f49a`

Bugfix release because of one important bug:

- :term:`watch_tim` didn't yet support synchronizing of Households.

Other changes:

- Detail of a Calendar now includes SubscriptionsByCalendar. 
  System Admin can now easily add Subscriptions for the concerned 
  users after creating a new Calendar.

- cal.Calendars, Persons, Companies and Partners now also 
  have their separate insert_layout

- cal.Tasks accidentally had 
  :attr:`debug_permissions <lino.core.model.Model.debug_permissions>` 
  set to `True`
  
- Setting:attr:`lino.Lino.build_js_cache_on_startup` to `True`
  didn't work.
