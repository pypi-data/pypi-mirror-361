description = Susie is a Python package for modeling the orbital evolution of exoplanets using transit and occultation timing data. It helps detect and characterize tidal orbital decay and apsidal precession, offering statistical tools to compare models and infer the physical processes shaping close-in planetary systemsâ€”linking timing data to insights on tidal dissipation, planetary interiors, and dynamical interactions.
