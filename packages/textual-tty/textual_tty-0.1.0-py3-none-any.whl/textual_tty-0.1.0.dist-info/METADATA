# textual-tty

A pure Python terminal emulator for Textual apps, that aims for tmux
compatibility.

Currently lacks a cursor, any decent debugging tools, and is too chatty,
but it's still somewhat usable.

## Demo

```bash
uvx textual-tty
```

## Usage

There's 3 main classes:

1. `Terminal`, a standalone terminal that doesn't need Textual.
2. `TextualTerminal`, a tty widget subclass.
3. `TerminalApp`, a terminal emulator in a window.

Read the demo code for more info.
