#  * That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results.
#  * The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process,
#  * e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library.
#  * As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE
#  * to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results.
