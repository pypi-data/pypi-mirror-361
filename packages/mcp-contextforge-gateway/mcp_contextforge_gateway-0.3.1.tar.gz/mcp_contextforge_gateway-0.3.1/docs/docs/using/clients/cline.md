     "mcpServers": {
         "mcpgateway-wrapper": {
            "disabled": true,
            "timeout": 60,
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
            "run",
            "--directory",
            "REPLACE_WITH_PATH_TO_REPO",
            "-m",
            "mcpgateway.wrapper"
            ],
            "env": {
               "MCP_SERVER_CATALOG_URLS": "http://localhost:4444",
               "MCP_AUTH_TOKEN": "REPLACE_WITH_MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN",
               "MCP_WRAPPER_LOG_LEVEL": "OFF"
            }
         }
      }
     ```

2. **Enable the MCP Server**:

## üß™ Using MCP Tools in Cline

Once connected:

- **Discover Tools**: Cline will automatically fetch and list available tools from the MCP Gateway.
- **Invoke Tools**: Use natural language prompts in Cline to invoke tools. For example:
  - "Run the `hello_world` tool with the argument `name: Alice`."
- **Monitor Responses**: Cline will display the tool's output directly within the chat interface.
