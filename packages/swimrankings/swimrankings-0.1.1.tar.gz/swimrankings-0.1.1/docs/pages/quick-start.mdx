# Quick Start

This guide will get you up and running with the SwimRankings library in minutes.

## Basic Search

The most common use case is searching for athletes by name:

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Search for athletes named "Druwel"
athletes = Athletes(name="Druwel")

# Print all found athletes
for athlete in athletes:
    print(f"{athlete.full_name} ({athlete.birth_year}) - {athlete.country}")
    print(f"Club: {athlete.club}")
    print(f"Profile: {athlete.profile_url}")
    print()
```

Output:
```
DRUWEL, Mauro (2008) - BEL
Club: BEL - TiMe Swimming Team
Profile: https://www.swimrankings.net/index.php?page=athleteDetail&athleteId=5199475

DRUWEL, Nora (2011) - BEL
Club: BEL - TiMe Swimming Team
Profile: https://www.swimrankings.net/index.php?page=athleteDetail&athleteId=5425825
```

## Getting Detailed Athlete Information

Once you have an athlete, you can fetch detailed information including personal bests:

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Search for an athlete
athletes = Athletes(name="Druwel")
athlete = athletes[0]  # Get the first athlete

# Fetch detailed information
details = athlete.get_details()

print(f"Details for {athlete.full_name}")
print(f"Last updated: {details.last_updated}")

# Display personal bests
if details.personal_bests:
    print("\nPersonal Bests:")
    for pb in details.personal_bests:
        print(f"  {pb.event} ({pb.course}): {pb.time}")
        if pb.date:
            print(f"    Date: {pb.date}")
        if pb.meet:
            print(f"    Meet: {pb.meet}")

# Display profile information
if details.profile_info:
    print("\nProfile Information:")
    for key, value in details.profile_info.items():
        print(f"  {key.title()}: {value}")
```

## Gender-Specific Searches

You can filter athletes by gender:

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Search for male athletes only
male_athletes = Athletes(name="Smith", gender="male")
print(f"Found {len(male_athletes)} male athletes")

# Search for female athletes only
female_athletes = Athletes(name="Smith", gender="female")
print(f"Found {len(female_athletes)} female athletes")

# Search all genders (default)
all_athletes = Athletes(name="Smith", gender="all")
print(f"Found {len(all_athletes)} total athletes")
```

## Working with Results

The `Athletes` class provides multiple ways to work with search results:

### Iteration

```python
athletes = Athletes(name="Johnson")

# Iterate through all athletes
for athlete in athletes:
    print(athlete.full_name)
```

### Indexing

```python
athletes = Athletes(name="Johnson")

if len(athletes) > 0:
    # Get first athlete
    first_athlete = athletes[0]
    print(f"First: {first_athlete.full_name}")
    
    # Get last athlete
    last_athlete = athletes[-1]
    print(f"Last: {last_athlete.full_name}")
    
    # Get subset using slicing
    first_three = athletes[0:3]
    print(f"First 3: {[a.full_name for a in first_three]}")
```

### Length and Boolean

```python
athletes = Athletes(name="Johnson")

# Check how many athletes found
print(f"Found {len(athletes)} athletes")

# Check if any athletes found
if athletes:
    print("Athletes found!")
else:
    print("No athletes found")
```

## Filtering Results

Apply additional filters to your search results:

```python
athletes = Athletes(name="Miller")

# Filter by country
usa_athletes = athletes.filter_by_country("USA")
print(f"USA athletes: {len(usa_athletes)}")

# Filter by birth year range
young_athletes = athletes.filter_by_birth_year(2005, 2015)
print(f"Born 2005-2015: {len(young_athletes)}")

# Filter by single birth year
born_2008 = athletes.filter_by_birth_year(2008)
print(f"Born in 2008: {len(born_2008)}")

# Filter by gender (post-search)
male_athletes = athletes.filter_by_gender("male")
print(f"Male athletes: {len(male_athletes)}")
```

## Accessing Athlete Data

Each athlete object provides detailed information:

```python
athletes = Athletes(name="Druwel")
athlete = athletes[0]  # Get first athlete

# Basic information
print(f"ID: {athlete.athlete_id}")
print(f"Full name: {athlete.full_name}")
print(f"First name: {athlete.first_name}")
print(f"Last name: {athlete.last_name}")

# Details
print(f"Birth year: {athlete.birth_year}")
print(f"Gender: {athlete.gender}")
print(f"Country: {athlete.country}")
print(f"Club: {athlete.club}")
print(f"Profile URL: {athlete.profile_url}")
```

## Error Handling

Always handle potential errors when working with external data:

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, AthleteNotFoundError, NetworkError

try:
    athletes = Athletes(name="NonexistentName")
    print(f"Found {len(athletes)} athletes")
    
except AthleteNotFoundError:
    print("No athletes found with that name")
    
except NetworkError as e:
    print(f"Network error: {e}")
    print("Please check your internet connection")
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

## Data Export

Convert athlete data to other formats:

```python
athletes = Athletes(name="Smith")

# Convert to list of dictionaries
athletes_dict = athletes.to_dict()
print(f"Exported {len(athletes_dict)} athletes")

# Example: save to JSON
import json
with open("athletes.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(athletes_dict, f, indent=2)

# Example: create DataFrame (requires pandas)
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(athletes_dict)
print(df.head())
```
