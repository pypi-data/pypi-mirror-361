#137 : Switch from Emacs to PyCharm
===================================

Here are some of these problems which I could not solve during my
second attempt to move from Emacs to PyCharm.

- When I open some file, PC warns me about a problem:

    Package requirements 'appy==0.8.4', 'django==1.5.1' ... [Install requirements] [Ignore requirements]

  And I did not find any explanation.

- It seems that I must define a "run environment" for everything I
  want to run from PyCharm.  Seems complicated.  I prefer my
  :ref:`fab_commands`.

- I could not get any test run to execute. It looked as if Django was
  not installed.

- Does PC support multiple Django settings per project?

- Is it true that PC `cannot easily wrap long lines into a paragraph
  <http://andrewbrookins.com/tech/wrap-comments-and-text-to-column-width-in-intellij-editors/>`_?

- Even with PC it is necessary to learn more about how to use Git (see
  :doc:`/dev/git`).
