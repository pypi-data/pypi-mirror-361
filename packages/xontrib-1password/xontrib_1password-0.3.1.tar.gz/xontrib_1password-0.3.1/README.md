## Installation

To install use pip:

```xsh
xpip install xontrib-1password
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/drmikecrowe/xontrib-1password
```

The xontrib will get loaded automatically.

## Usage

For maximum security, enable your secrets dynamically using the command below when required. You may also enable permanently and expose your secrets at all times in your [Run Control (RC) file](https://xon.sh/xonshrc.html):

```xsh
$XONTRIB_1PASSWORD_ENABLED = True
```

Store your passwords in [1Password](https://1password.com/) and setup [`op` CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/) locally.
Then:
```xsh
mykey = OnePass("op://path/my/key")
echo @(mykey)
# my-key-value

$MYKEY = OnePass("op://path/my/key")
echo $MYKEY
# my-key-value

env | grep MYKEY
# MYKEY=my-key-value
```

## Good to know

### Disabling

To disable autoloading:
```xsh
$XONTRIBS_AUTOLOAD_DISABLED = ["1password", ]
```
To turn off:
```xsh
$XONTRIB_1PASSWORD_ENABLED = False
$MYKEY = OnePass("op://path/my/key")
$MYKEY
# op://path/my/key
```

### Get certain key

Because of the URL is basically `op://<Vault>/<title>/<field>` to find this, here's the commands you can use to determine these fields:

```sh
op item list --format json | jq '.[].title | select(. | contains("OpenAI"))'
# "OpenAI-API-Key"
op item get OpenAI-API-Key --format json | jq '.fields[] | select(.type == "CONCEALED") | .label'
# "api-key"
```

### Debug mode

```xsh
$XONTRIB_1PASSWORD_DEBUG = True
```

### Cache

You can set `$XONTRIB_1PASSWORD_CACHE` to string:
* `not_empty` (default) - cache not empty values.
* `all` - cache all values.
* `off` - disable caching.

## Known issues

### Slowing down reading environment variables

If you disable cache (i.e. `$XONTRIB_1PASSWORD_CACHE='off'`) in case of `$MYVAR = OnePass(...)` every time the shell read the env variables list the value will be requested from OnePassword and it takes time.

## Development

- activate [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) hooks
```sh
# install pre-commit plugins and activate the commit hook
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
```

### Releasing your package

- Bump the version of your package.
- Create a GitHub release (The release notes are automatically generated as a draft release after each push).
- And publish with `poetry publish --build` or `twine`
