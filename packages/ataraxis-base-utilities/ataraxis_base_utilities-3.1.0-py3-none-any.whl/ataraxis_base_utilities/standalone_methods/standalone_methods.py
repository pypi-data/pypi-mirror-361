"""This module contains miscellaneous methods that either abstract away common operations to reduce boilerplate code or
provide functionality not commonly available from popular Python libraries.

Methods from this module largely belong to two groups. The first group is for 'convenience' methods. These methods
typically abstract away template code that is readily available from Python or common libraries (a good example is the
ensure_list() method). Another set of methods, such as compare_nested_tuples() method, provides novel functionality
not readily available from other libraries. Both groups of methods are useful for a wide range of data-related
applications.

See the API documentation for the description of the methods offered through this module.

    Notes:
        This function makes no attempt to further validate object data or structure outside of making sure it is
