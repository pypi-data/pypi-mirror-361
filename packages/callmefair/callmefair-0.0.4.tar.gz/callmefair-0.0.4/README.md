## Overview* <a name="overview"></a>
The integration of machine learning (ML) into healthcare demands rigorous fairness assurance to prevent algorithmic biases from exacerbating disparities in treatment. This study introduces FairHealthGrid, a systematic framework for evaluating bias mitigation strategies across healthcare ML models. Our framework combines grid search with a composite fairness score, incorporating fairness metrics weighted by risk tolerances. As output, we present a trade-off map concurrently evaluating accuracy and fairness, categorizing solutions (model + bias mitigation) into the following regions: Win-Win, Good, Poor, Inverted, or Lose-Lose. We apply the framework on three different healthcare datasets. Results reveal significant variability across different healthcare applications. The framework identifies model-bias mitigation for balancing equity and accuracy, yet highlights the absence of universal solutions. By enabling systematic trade-off analysis, FairHealthGrid allows healthcare stakeholders to audit, compare, and select ethically aligned ML models for specific healthcare applications—advancing towards equitable AI in healthcare.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

### Key Findings

Our evaluation across three healthcare datasets reveals that **preprocessing and in-processing strategies offer the best balance between fairness and accuracy**, while multi-stage bias mitigation approaches risk over-correction. The framework demonstrates significant variability in bias mitigation effectiveness across different healthcare applications, highlighting the absence of universal solutions.

### Main Contributions

We introduce **FairHealthGrid**, a comprehensive framework that addresses critical gaps in healthcare AI fairness evaluation:

1. **Systematic Evaluation Framework**: Exhaustive grid search optimization for model-strategy combinations in healthcare AI
2. **Unified Fairness Score (𝓕)**: Integrates five fairness metrics with risk tolerances for comprehensive bias assessment
3. **Interpretable Trade-off Maps**: Context-driven model selection through fairness-accuracy visualization

### Framework Benefits

- **Model-agnostic design** enabling evaluation across diverse ML architectures
- **Context-specific evaluations** prioritizing datasets with sensitive attributes
- **Actionable insights** for clinical deployment decisions
- **Systematic methodology** for selecting appropriate bias mitigation strategies

### Limitations & Future Work

Current evaluations focus on single protected attributes. Future research will address intersectional bias from interacting sensitive features, expand to new data modalities, and formalize a comprehensive bias taxonomy using causal fairness frameworks.

*Figure 1: Proposed approach consists of three main stages: (A) Grid Search, where multiple machine learning models (ML) and bias mitigation (BM) strategies are evaluated; (B) Computation of the Combined Fairness Score (𝓕), aggregating multiple fairness measures to quantify bias; and (C) Fairness Trade-off Mapping, which utilizes the baseline fairness score 𝓕baseline and naive mutation strategies (𝓕10–𝓕100) to generate a trade-off curve. The final trade-off map categorizes models into trade-off regions.*
