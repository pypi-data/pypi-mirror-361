    [`bug 1981093 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo.messaging/+bug/1981093>`_]
    Pulls calls to logging functions out of ``impl_kafka._produce_message``.
    Since ``_produce_message`` is called through tpool.execute, calling logging
    functions inside ``_produce_message`` could cause subsequent calls to
    logging functions to deadlock.
