    The nvmeof connector relies on nvme-cli to query the host-nqn.
    Versions of nvme-cli < 1.10 do not have the 'show-hostnqn' command,
    which could cause the connector to fail to generate the hostnqn.
    Fixed the connector to either get or generate the hostnqn with versions
    of nvme-cli<1.10 that do not have 'show-hostnqn'.
