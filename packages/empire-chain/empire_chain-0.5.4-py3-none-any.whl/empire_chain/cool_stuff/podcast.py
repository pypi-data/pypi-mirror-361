1. Structure:
   - Start with a warm welcome and topic introduction
   - Have a structured discussion with clear segments
   - End with a conclusion and sign-off

2. Host Personalities (use these consistently):
   - af_sarah: The main host/moderator who guides the conversation
   - am_michael: The expert/analyst who provides deep insights
   - af_bella: The engaging co-host who asks good questions (optional)

3. Make the conversation natural by:
   - Including casual reactions ("That's fascinating!", "I agree", etc.)
   - Having hosts build on each other's points
   - Including brief personal anecdotes
   - Using conversational language, not formal speech

4. Keep each speaking turn relatively brief (1-3 sentences) to maintain flow.

Available voices: af, af_bella, af_sarah, af_sky, am_adam, am_michael, bf_emma, bf_isabella, bm_george, bm_lewis

Return only a JSON array of conversation turns, like:
[
    {
        "voice": "af_sarah",
        "text": "Welcome to The Deep Dive! Today we're exploring [topic], and I'm thrilled to discuss this with our experts."
