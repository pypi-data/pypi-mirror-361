`borb` is a powerful and flexible Python library for creating and manipulating PDF files.

## üìñ Overview

`borb` provides a pure Python solution for PDF document management, allowing users to read, write, and manipulate PDFs. It models PDF files in a JSON-like structure, using nested lists, dictionaries, and primitives (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.). Created and maintained as a solo project, `borb` prioritizes common PDF use cases for practical and straightforward usage.

## ‚ú® Features

Explore `borb`‚Äôs capabilities in the [examples repository](https://github.com/jorisschellekens/borb-examples) for practical, real-world applications, including:

- PDF Metadata Management (reading, editing)
- Text and Image Extraction
- Adding Annotations (notes, links)
- Content Manipulation (adding text, images, tables, lists)
- Page Layout Management with `PageLayout`

‚Ä¶and much more!

## üöÄ Installation

Install `borb` directly via `pip`:

```bash
pip install borb
```

To ensure you have the latest version, consider the following commands:

```bash
pip uninstall borb
pip install --no-cache borb
```

## üëã Getting Started: Hello World

Create your first PDF in just a few lines of code with `borb`:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from borb.pdf import Document, Page, PageLayout, SingleColumnLayout, Paragraph, PDF

# Create an empty Document
d: Document = Document()

# Create an empty Page
p: Page = Page()
d.append_page(p)

# Create a PageLayout
l: PageLayout = SingleColumnLayout(p)

# Add a Paragraph
l.append_layout_element(Paragraph('Hello World!'))

# Write the PDF
PDF.write(what=d, where_to="assets/output.pdf")

```

## üõ† License

`borb` is dual-licensed under AGPL and a commercial license. 

The AGPL (Affero General Public License) is an open-source license, but commercial use cases require a paid license, especially if you intend to:

- Offer paid PDF services (e.g., PDF generation in cloud applications)
- Use `borb` in closed-source projects
- Distribute `borb` in any closed-source product
