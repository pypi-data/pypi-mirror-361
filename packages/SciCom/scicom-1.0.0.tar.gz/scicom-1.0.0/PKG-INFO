# SciCom

Simulating various aspects of scientific communication via Agent-based models.

In this first version, we introduce an agent-based modelling approach to reconstruct communication in
the Republic of Letters.

Documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://scientificcommunication.readthedocs.io).

## Installation

tl;dr Use pip

~~~bash
pip install scicom
~~~

Consider using a clean virtual environment to keep your main packages separated.
Create a new virtual environment and install the package

~~~bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install scicom
~~~

## Examples

You can find an example Jupyter Notebook showing the use of the LetterSpace model in the [examples folder](../examples/RunModel.ipynb).

Alternatively, you can use the mesa server framework to create an local browser interface with changeable parameters,
see screenshot below and [documentation on running mesa](usingmesa.rst).

## Testing

Tests can be run by installing the _test_ requirements and running `tox`.

~~~bash
pip install scicom[test]
tox
~~~

## Building documentation

The documentation is build using _sphinx_. Install with the _docs_ option and run

~~~bash
pip install scicom[docs]
tox -e docs
~~~

## Funding information

The development was part of the research project [ModelSEN](https://modelsen.gea.mpg.de)

> Socio-epistemic networks: Modelling Historical Knowledge Processes,

in Department I of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin,
and funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (Grant No. 01 UG2131).

The work is continued in the department for Structural Changes of the Technosphere
at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology, Jena.
