#77 : AJAX API for DELETE and other actions
===========================================

How am I supposed to manage the case when a user asks to perform an 
action on multiple rows?

For example imagine a client which retrieves a list of elements using::

  GET http://example.com/foos
  
then it displays that list to the user in a grid, 
the user selects some of those rows and hits a "Delete" button.

Imagine the selected rows have primary keys 123, 124 and 127. 
After all I've read about the RESTful API, I imagine that the client 
should now issue the following HTTP requests::

  DELETE http://example.com/foos/123
  DELETE http://example.com/foos/124
  DELETE http://example.com/foos/127
  
But I would like the user to receive a confirmation 
"Are you sure you want to delete these 3 rows..?", 
and I'd like to construct this question dynamically *on the server*.
Is that possible while remaining RESTful?

Maybe something like::

  GET http://example.com/foos/?action=delete,selected=[123,124,127]
  
which would **not** delete anything, it would just return the text of 
the confirmation question to ask.
