# Installation

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection for accessing swimrankings.net

## Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install swimrankings
```

## Install from Source

If you want to install the latest development version:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MauroDruwel/Swimrankings.git
cd Swimrankings

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Development Installation

For development work, install with development dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MauroDruwel/Swimrankings.git
cd Swimrankings

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Verify Installation

To verify that the installation was successful, try importing the library:

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Test with a simple search
try:
    athletes = Athletes(name="Test")
    print("✅ SwimRankings library installed successfully!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Installation issue: {e}")
```

## Dependencies

The library requires the following packages:

- **requests**: For HTTP requests to swimrankings.net
- **beautifulsoup4**: For HTML parsing
- **lxml**: Fast XML/HTML parser

These are automatically installed when you install the library.

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

If you get import errors, make sure you've installed the library correctly:

```bash
pip show swimrankings
```

### Network Issues

The library requires internet access to fetch data from swimrankings.net. If you're behind a corporate firewall, you may need to configure proxy settings:

```python
import requests

# Configure proxy if needed
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://your-proxy:port',
    'https': 'https://your-proxy:port'
}

# The library doesn't currently support proxy configuration directly
# You may need to set environment variables
```

### Python Version Issues

Make sure you're using Python 3.8 or higher:

```bash
python --version
```

If you have multiple Python versions installed, you might need to use `python3` or `pip3` instead.
