#97 : choosers with GenericForeignKey in context
================================================

If you define a chooser with a context variable that corresponds to a
GenericForeignKey field (as would be needed e.g. in
:meth:`lino.modlib.attestations.Attestation.type_choices`) then Lino
doesn't correctly convert that field's value. But gives a javascript
string representation or something else, but not an object.

Since :blogref:`20140210` there is a solution using
:class:`lino.utils.instantiator.GenericForeignKeyConverter`.  Rather
hackerish but works for me.
