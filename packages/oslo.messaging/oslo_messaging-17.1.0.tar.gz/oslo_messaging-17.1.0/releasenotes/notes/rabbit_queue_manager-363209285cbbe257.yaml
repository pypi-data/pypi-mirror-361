    Add three new options (``use_queue_manager``, ``hostname``,
    ``processname``) to switch oslo.messaging from random queue names
    (for reply_q and fanouts) to consistent naming.
    The default value is False, so oslo.messaging will still use random queue
    names if nothing is set in configuration file of services.
    When switching use_queue_manager to True, the uuid4 random string from the
    queue name is replaced with a combination of hostname, processname and
    counter.
    The counter will be kept in shared memory (/dev/shm/x_y_qmanager).
    This way, when a service using oslo.messaging restarts (e.g. neutron),
    it will re-create the queues using the same name as the previous run, so
    no new queues are created and no need for rabbitmq to delete the previous
    queues.
    This is extremely useful for operator to debug which queue belong to which
    server/process.
    It's also higlhy recommended to enable this feature when using quorum
    queues for transient (option named ``rabbit_transient_quorum_queue``) to
    avoid consuming all erlang atoms after some time.
