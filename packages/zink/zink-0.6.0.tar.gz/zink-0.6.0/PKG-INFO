  <h1>ZINK (Zero-shot Ink)</h1>
</div>
ZINK is a Python package designed for zero-shot anonymization of entities within unstructured text data. It allows you to redact or replace sensitive information based on specified entity labels.

## Description

In today's data-driven world, protecting sensitive information is paramount. ZINK provides a simple and effective solution for anonymizing text data by identifying and masking entities such as names, ages, phone numbers, medical conditions, and more. With ZINK, you can ensure data privacy while still maintaining the utility of your text data for analysis and processing.

ZINK leverages the power of zero-shot techniques, meaning it doesn't require prior training on specific datasets. You simply provide the text and the entity labels you want to anonymize, and ZINK handles the rest.

## Features

-   **Zero-shot anonymization:** No training data or pre-trained models required.
-   **Flexible entity labeling:** Anonymize any type of entity by specifying custom labels.
-   **Redaction and replacement:** Choose between redacting entities (replacing them with `[LABEL]_REDACTED`) or replacing them with a generic placeholder.
-   **Easy integration:** Simple and intuitive API for seamless integration into your Python projects.

## Installation

```bash
pip install zink
```
## Usage

### For details, check out the [Documentation](https://zink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Redacting Entities
The redact function replaces identified entities with [LABEL]_REDACTED.

```bash
import zink as zn

text = "John works as a doctor and plays football after work and drives a toyota."
labels = ("person", "profession", "sport", "car")
result = zn.redact(text, labels)
print(result.anonymized_text)
Example output:

person_REDACTED works as a profession_REDACTED and plays sport_REDACTED after work and drives a car_REDACTED.
```

### Replacing Entities
The replace function replaces identified entities with a random entity of the same type.

```bash
import zink as zn

text = "John Doe dialled his mother at 992-234-3456 and then went out for a walk."
labels = ("person", "phone number", "relationship")
result = zn.replace(text, labels)
print(result.anonymized_text)

#Possible output: Warren Buffet dialled his Uncle at 2347789287 and then went out for a walk.
```

Another example:

```bash
import zink as zn

text = "Patient, 33 years old, was admitted with a chest pain"
labels = ("age", "medical condition")
result = zn.replace(text, labels)
print(result.anonymized_text)
Example output:

Patient, 78 years old, was admitted with a Diabetes Mellitus.
```

### Replacing Entities with your own data
This feature is for the scenario when you want to replace entities with your own dataset. Unlike the standard replace method, this function does not use caching and therefore accepts replacements as dictionaries directly, simplifying its use for dynamic or runtime-defined pseudonyms.

```bash
text = "Melissa works at Google and drives a Tesla."
labels = ("person", "company", "car")
custom_replacements = {
    "person": "Alice",
    "company": "OpenAI",
    "car": ("Honda", "Toyota")
    }

result = zink.replace_with_my_data(text, labels, user_replacements=custom_replacements)

print(result.anonymized_text)
# Possible Output: "Alice works at OpenAI and drives a Honda."
```

### Shielding LLM and API Calls (Decorator)

For advanced use cases, like protecting sensitive data in a RAG pipeline or before calling an external LLM API, you can use the `@zink.shield` decorator. It provides a complete "shield" that automatically anonymizes function inputs and re-identifies the outputs.

This handles the full anonymization and re-identification cycle for you.

**Example:**

```python
import zink as zn

# This mock function simulates calling an external API (like OpenAI or Gemini)
@zn.shield(target_arg='prompt', labels=('person', 'company'))
def call_sensitive_api(prompt: str):
    """
    This function is 'shielded'. The decorator will anonymize the 'prompt'
    argument before this function is executed and re-identify its return value.
    """
    # The prompt received here is already anonymized by the decorator.
    # The external API would process it and return a response with placeholders.
    # For this example, we'll simulate that response.
    # e.g., prompt would be "Report for person_1234_REDACTED from company_5678_REDACTED."
    
    anonymized_response = f"Analysis for {prompt.split(' ')[2]} from {prompt.split(' ')[4]} is complete."
    return anonymized_response

# The original, sensitive text
sensitive_data = "Report for John Doe from Acme Inc."

# Call the function as you normally would. The decorator handles everything.
final_result = call_sensitive_api(prompt=sensitive_data)

# The final result is already re-identified.
print(final_result)

Analysis for John Doe from Acme Inc. is complete.

```

## Under the hood:

### [GLiNER](https://github.com/urchade/GLiNER):
GLiNER is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model capable of identifying any entity type using a bidirectional transformer encoder (BERT-like). It provides a practical alternative to traditional NER models, which are limited to predefined entities, and Large Language Models (LLMs) that, despite their flexibility, are costly and large for resource-constrained scenarios.

### [NuNer](https://huggingface.co/numind/NuNER_Zero):
NuNerZero is a compact, zero-shot Named Entity Recognition model that leverages the robust GLiNER architecture for efficient token classification. It requires lower-cased labels and processes inputs as a concatenation of entity types and text, enabling it to detect arbitrarily long entities. Trained on the NuNER v2.0 dataset, NuNerZero achieves impressive performance, outperforming larger models like GLiNER-large-v2.1 by over 3% in token-level F1-score. This model is ideal for both research and practical applications where a streamlined, high-accuracy NER solution is essential.

### [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/)
Zink now leverages the Faker library to generate realistic, synthetic replacements for sensitive information. This feature is relatively new and continues to evolve, enhancing our data masking capabilities while preserving contextual plausibility.

#### How Faker Is Utilized
Dynamic Data Generation:
Faker is used to generate replacement values for various entity types (e.g., names, addresses, dates). For example, when a human name is detected, Faker can provide a full name or first name based on context.

#### Country and Location Handling:
Our tool reads a list of country names (and their synonyms) from an external file. If a location entity matches one of these names, the system selects a different country from the list to mask the sensitive geographical data.

#### Date Replacement:
Date-related entities (such as dates, months, and days) are delegated to a dedicated strategy. For purely numeric dates (e.g., "12/02/1975"), the tool returns a Faker-generated date. For dates with explicit alphabetic month names, custom extraction and replacement logic is applied.

#### Human Entity Roles:
The system differentiates between various human roles (e.g., doctor, patient, engineer) using a predefined list of human entity roles. This allows for context-aware replacement, ensuring that names are replaced appropriately according to their role in the text.

#### Current Status and Future Improvements
##### New Feature in Beta:
The Faker integration is one of our latest features, designed to deliver more natural and contextually relevant data replacements. While the current implementation covers many common cases, it is still under active development.

### Testing
To run the tests, navigate to the project directory and execute:
