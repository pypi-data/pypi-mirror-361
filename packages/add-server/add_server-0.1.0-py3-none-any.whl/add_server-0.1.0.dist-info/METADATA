# ADD TWO NUMBER BY MCP SERVER

This package provides a simple MCP server that exposes a tool to add two numbers, using the [MCP Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/mcp/).

## Installation

You need Python 3.13+ and the MCP package. Install dependencies with:

```sh
pip install "mcp[cli]>=1.11.0"
```

Or, if using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
uv pip install "mcp[cli]>=1.11.0"
```

## Usage

### As a CLI script

If installed as a package, you can run the server with:

```sh
add-server
```

### As a Python module

You can also run the server using the module syntax:

```sh
python -m add_server
```

This will start the MCP server, exposing a tool to add two numbers. You can connect to it using MCP-compatible clients or tools.

## MCP Server Details

The server is implemented using the [FastMCP](https://pypi.org/project/mcp/) class from the MCP SDK. The main entry point is defined in `src/add_server/__init__.py` and is called by both the CLI and module entry points.

For more details on MCP, see the [MCP PyPI documentation](https://pypi.org/project/mcp/) or the [refs/add-server.md](refs/add-server.md) file in this repository.
