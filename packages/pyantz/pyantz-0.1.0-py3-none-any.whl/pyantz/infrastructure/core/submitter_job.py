"""Submitter jobs are "final" jobs which will submit a new pipeline based
Unlike simple jobs, Submitter jobs have access to the outer scope, including
    variables and the parent pipeline configuration

These types of jobs are much more powerful, allowing for the modification of the parent
    (eg., resetting the current stage) or dynamic variable updating

But, of course, they introduce all kinds of problems. For example, static checking
    to remove errors may not be possible if Submitter jobs are present.

Where possible, **avoid** Submitter jobs. Earlier versions removed them due to
    the danger posed by mutability

Submitter jobs have a few very important rules
-> Submitter jobs must ALSO be the very last job in a pipeline
