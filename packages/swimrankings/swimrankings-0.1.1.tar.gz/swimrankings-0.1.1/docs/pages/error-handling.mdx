# Error Handling

Learn how to handle errors gracefully when working with the SwimRankings library.

## Exception Hierarchy

The SwimRankings library provides a clear hierarchy of exceptions:

```
SwimRankingsError (base exception)
├── NetworkError
├── AthleteNotFoundError
├── InvalidGenderError
└── ParseError
```

## Common Exceptions

### AthleteNotFoundError

Raised when no athletes are found for the given search criteria.

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, AthleteNotFoundError

try:
    athletes = Athletes(name="NonexistentName")
except AthleteNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"No athletes found: {e}")
```

**Common causes:**
- Misspelled athlete name
- Very uncommon name
- Restrictive gender filter

### NetworkError

Raised when there's a network-related issue.

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, NetworkError

try:
    athletes = Athletes(name="Smith")
except NetworkError as e:
    print(f"Network error: {e}")
    print("Please check your internet connection")
```

**Common causes:**
- No internet connection
- Server is temporarily down
- Request timeout
- DNS resolution failure
- Firewall blocking requests

### InvalidGenderError

Raised when an invalid gender value is provided.

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, InvalidGenderError

try:
    athletes = Athletes(name="Smith", gender="invalid")
except InvalidGenderError as e:
    print(f"Invalid gender: {e}")
```

**Valid gender values:** `"all"`, `"male"`, `"female"`

### ParseError

Raised when the HTML response cannot be parsed properly.

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, ParseError

try:
    athletes = Athletes(name="Smith")
except ParseError as e:
    print(f"Parse error: {e}")
    print("The website might have changed its format")
```

**Common causes:**
- Website structure changes
- Unexpected HTML format
- Corrupted response data

## Best Practices

### Comprehensive Error Handling

Always handle the most specific exceptions first:

```python
from swimrankings import (
    Athletes,
    AthleteNotFoundError,
    NetworkError,
    InvalidGenderError,
    ParseError,
    SwimRankingsError
)

def search_athletes_safely(name, gender="all"):
    try:
        athletes = Athletes(name=name, gender=gender)
        return list(athletes)
        
    except InvalidGenderError as e:
        print(f"❌ Invalid gender parameter: {e}")
        return []
        
    except AthleteNotFoundError:
        print(f"🔍 No athletes found for '{name}' with gender '{gender}'")
        return []
        
    except NetworkError as e:
        print(f"🌐 Network error: {e}")
        print("Please check your internet connection and try again.")
        return []
        
    except ParseError as e:
        print(f"⚠️ Parse error: {e}")
        print("The website format might have changed.")
        return []
        
    except SwimRankingsError as e:
        print(f"❌ SwimRankings error: {e}")
        return []
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"💥 Unexpected error: {e}")
        return []

# Usage
athletes = search_athletes_safely("Smith", "male")
if athletes:
    print(f"✅ Found {len(athletes)} athletes")
```

### Retry Logic for Network Errors

Implement retry logic for transient network issues:

```python
import time
from swimrankings import Athletes, NetworkError

def search_with_retry(name, max_retries=3, base_delay=1):
    """Search with exponential backoff retry."""
    last_error = None
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            athletes = Athletes(name=name)
            return list(athletes)
            
        except NetworkError as e:
            last_error = e
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                break
                
            delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
            print(f"Network error (attempt {attempt + 1}/{max_retries}): {e}")
            print(f"Retrying in {delay} seconds...")
            time.sleep(delay)
    
    raise NetworkError(f"Failed after {max_retries} attempts. Last error: {last_error}")

# Usage
try:
    athletes = search_with_retry("Smith")
    print(f"Success! Found {len(athletes)} athletes")
except NetworkError as e:
    print(f"Failed to search: {e}")
```

### Timeout Configuration

Configure timeouts based on your needs:

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, NetworkError

# Short timeout for quick checks
try:
    athletes = Athletes(name="Smith", timeout=5)
except NetworkError:
    print("Quick search failed, trying with longer timeout...")
    
    # Longer timeout for slower connections
    try:
        athletes = Athletes(name="Smith", timeout=30)
    except NetworkError:
        print("Search failed even with extended timeout")
```

### Graceful Degradation

Handle partial failures gracefully:

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, AthleteNotFoundError, NetworkError

def search_multiple_names(names):
    """Search for multiple names, handling failures gracefully."""
    results = {}
    
    for name in names:
        try:
            athletes = Athletes(name=name)
            results[name] = list(athletes)
            print(f"✅ {name}: {len(athletes)} athletes")
            
        except AthleteNotFoundError:
            results[name] = []
            print(f"🔍 {name}: No athletes found")
            
        except NetworkError as e:
            results[name] = None
            print(f"🌐 {name}: Network error - {e}")
            
        except Exception as e:
            results[name] = None
            print(f"❌ {name}: Unexpected error - {e}")
    
    return results

# Usage
names = ["Smith", "Johnson", "Williams"]
results = search_multiple_names(names)

# Process results
successful_searches = [name for name, athletes in results.items() if athletes is not None]
print(f"Successful searches: {len(successful_searches)}")
```

## Logging Errors

Use Python's logging module for better error tracking:

```python
import logging
from swimrankings import Athletes, SwimRankingsError

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('swimrankings.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def search_with_logging(name, gender="all"):
    """Search with comprehensive logging."""
    logger.info(f"Starting search for '{name}' with gender '{gender}'")
    
    try:
        athletes = Athletes(name=name, gender=gender)
        athlete_list = list(athletes)
        logger.info(f"Search successful: found {len(athlete_list)} athletes")
        return athlete_list
        
    except SwimRankingsError as e:
        logger.error(f"SwimRankings error during search: {e}")
        return []
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"Unexpected error during search: {e}")
        return []

# Usage
athletes = search_with_logging("Smith", "male")
```

## Testing Error Conditions

When writing tests, you can simulate error conditions:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from swimrankings import Athletes, NetworkError

def test_network_error_handling():
    """Test that network errors are handled properly."""
    with patch('swimrankings.athletes.requests.get') as mock_get:
        mock_get.side_effect = Exception("Network error")
        
        with pytest.raises(NetworkError):
            Athletes(name="Test")

def test_invalid_gender():
    """Test invalid gender parameter."""
    with pytest.raises(InvalidGenderError):
        Athletes(name="Test", gender="invalid")
```

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Verbose Error Messages

```python
import requests
from swimrankings import Athletes

# Enable requests logging for debugging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

try:
    athletes = Athletes(name="Test")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error details: {e}")
    print(f"Error type: {type(e)}")
```

### Check Response Content

For debugging parse errors:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Manual request to debug
url = "https://www.swimrankings.net/index.php"
params = {
    'internalRequest': 'athleteFind',
    'athlete_clubId': -1,
    'athlete_gender': -1,
    'athlete_lastname': 'TestName',
    'athlete_firstname': ''
}

response = requests.get(url, params=params)
print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Response length: {len(response.text)}")
print(f"First 500 chars: {response.text[:500]}")

# Check if table exists
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml')
table = soup.find('table', class_='athleteSearch')
print(f"Table found: {table is not None}")
```

## Recovery Strategies

### Fallback to Different Parameters

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, AthleteNotFoundError

def flexible_search(name):
    """Try different search strategies."""
    strategies = [
        {"gender": "all"},
        {"gender": "male"},
        {"gender": "female"},
    ]
    
    for strategy in strategies:
        try:
            athletes = Athletes(name=name, **strategy)
            print(f"Found {len(athletes)} athletes with strategy: {strategy}")
            return list(athletes)
        except AthleteNotFoundError:
            continue
    
    print(f"No athletes found for '{name}' with any strategy")
    return []
```

### Partial Name Matching

```python
from swimrankings import Athletes, AthleteNotFoundError

def smart_search(full_name):
    """Try searching with different parts of the name."""
    name_parts = full_name.split()
    
    for part in name_parts:
        if len(part) >= 3:  # Only try meaningful parts
            try:
                athletes = Athletes(name=part)
                # Filter results to match the original search intent
                matching = [
                    athlete for athlete in athletes
                    if any(name_part.lower() in athlete.full_name.lower() 
                          for name_part in name_parts)
                ]
                if matching:
                    return matching
            except AthleteNotFoundError:
                continue
    
    return []

# Usage
athletes = smart_search("John Smith")
```
