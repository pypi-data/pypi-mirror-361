# Disney+ API wrapper

A feature rich API wrapper for Disney+ made with python. 

Allows for audio and subtitle download!


## How to install
    pip install pydisney

https://pypi.org/project/pydisney

## Usage/Examples

### Simple search
```python
from pydisney import DisneyAPI

api = DisneyAPI(email="email", password="password")
searches = api.search("Star wars")
print(searches[0].title) # prints title of the first search hit
```
### More examples

```python
from pydisney import DisneyAPI
from pydisney.models.Language import Language

# forces to use disney's login api instead of cached access and refresh tokens
api = DisneyAPI(email="email", password="password", force_login=True)

profile = api.get_profiles()[0]  # grabs the first profile
print(api.set_active_profile(profile.id)) # if profile is locked, pass pin as an argument
active_profile = api.get_active_profile()
active_profile.set_profile_language(Language.English_UK) # sets language to english, from now all data will be returned in that language


searches = api.search("Star wars")
print(searches[0].title)

# checks if the search hit is a series or a movie
if searches[0].is_movie:
    print(searches[0].length)  # returns in milliseconds
    print(searches[0].credits)  # gets cast, directors etc

else:
    # prints s01e01's full description
    print(searches[0].seasons[0].episodes[0].full_description)
```

### Download Audio and Subtitles
> [!WARNING]  
> Audio download requires `ffmpeg` installed and available in PATH.

```python
from pydisney import DisneyAPI

episode = api.search("Andor")[0].seasons[0].episodes[0]
selector = episode.get_track_selector()

print(selector.available_languages())

audio_group = selector.get_audios(language="pl")
best_audio = audio_group.filter_by_codec("eac").get_best_quality().download() # codec: eac or aac
best_audio.download()

sub = selector.get_subtitles("pl").get_forced().first()
sub.download("subtitle-name.vtt") # pass file name if you want. Subtitles are ALWAYS in vtt format
```
