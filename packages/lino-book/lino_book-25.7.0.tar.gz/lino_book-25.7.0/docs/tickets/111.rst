#111: See who's logged in
=========================

Django's logout signal work only when the user explicitly clicks the
logout button. Which usually is not the case. So we need something
more. Per user we need to track the timestamp of last request.  And
then we can define a table with the users who had some activity during
the last X minutes (some configurable timeout).



LuckiDog published a 
`snippet 
<https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/449/>`_
for this in October 2007::

    class AutoLogout:
      def process_request(self, request):
        if not request.user.is_authenticated() :
          #Can't log out if not logged in
          return

        try:
          if datetime.now() - request.session['last_touch'] > timedelta( 0, settings.AUTO_LOGOUT_DELAY * 60, 0):
            auth.logout(request)
            del request.session['last_touch']
            return
        except KeyError:
          pass

        request.session['last_touch'] = datetime.now()
