  <em>A flexible library for similarity searches of supernovae and their host galaxies.</em>
</p>

reLAISS lets you retrieve nearest‑neighbour supernovae (or spot outliers) by combining ZTF $g/r$ light‑curve morphology with Pan‑STARRS host‑galaxy colours. A pre‑built reference index allows users find similar events to a queried object in seconds. reLAISS is designed to be modular; feel free to customize for your own science!

# Install

Installation of the package is easy: In a fresh conda environment, run `pip install relaiss`


# Code Demo
```
import relaiss as rl

client = rl.ReLAISS()

# load reference data
client.load_reference(
    path_to_sfd_folder='./sfddata-master',  # Directory for SFD dust maps
    weight_lc=3, # Upweight lightcurve features for neighbor search
)

# Find the 5 closest matches to a ZTF transient
neigh = client.find_neighbors(
        ztf_object_id='ZTF21abbzjeq',  # Using the test transient
        n=5,  # number of neighbors to retrieve
        plot=True, # plot and save figures
        save_figures=True,
        path_to_figure_directory='./figures'
    )

# print closest neighbors and their distances
print(neigh[["iau_name", "dist"]])
```
