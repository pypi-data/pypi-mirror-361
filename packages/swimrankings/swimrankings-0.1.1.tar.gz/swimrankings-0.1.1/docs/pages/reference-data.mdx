# Reference Data

The SwimRankings library provides functions to fetch and work with reference data from swimrankings.net, including country codes and time period selections.

## Countries and Nations

The library can fetch all available countries/nations with their IDs, codes, and names:

```python
import swimrankings

# Fetch all available countries
countries = swimrankings.fetch_countries()
print(f"Found {len(countries)} countries")

# Get country information by nation ID
country_name = swimrankings.get_country_name("43")  # Returns "Belgium"
country_code = swimrankings.get_country_code("43")  # Returns "BEL"

# Find nation ID by country code
nation_id = swimrankings.find_nation_id_by_code("BEL")  # Returns "43"
```

## Time Periods and Month Codes

You can also fetch time period codes used for filtering meets by date:

```python
import swimrankings

# Fetch all available time periods
periods = swimrankings.fetch_time_periods()
print(f"Found {len(periods)} time periods")

# Get available years
years = swimrankings.get_available_years()
print(f"Available years: {years[:5]}...")  # [2025, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021]

# Get months for a specific year
months_2024 = swimrankings.get_months_for_year(2024)
for code, name in months_2024.items():
    print(f"{code}: {name}")
    # Output: 2024_m12: 2024 - December, etc.
```

## Caching for Performance

For better performance when making repeated calls, use the cached versions:

```python
import swimrankings

# Use cached versions for better performance on repeated calls
countries = swimrankings.get_cached_countries()
periods = swimrankings.get_cached_time_periods()

# Clear cache if needed (e.g., to refresh data)
swimrankings.clear_cache()
```

## Available Functions

### Country Functions
- `fetch_countries()` - Fetch all countries from swimrankings.net
- `get_country_name(nation_id)` - Get country name by nation ID
- `get_country_code(nation_id)` - Get 3-letter country code by nation ID
- `find_nation_id_by_code(country_code)` - Find nation ID by country code (case-insensitive)

### Time Period Functions
- `fetch_time_periods()` - Fetch all time periods/month codes
- `get_available_years()` - Get list of available years (sorted descending)
- `get_months_for_year(year)` - Get months for specific year

### Caching Functions
- `get_cached_countries()` - Get countries with caching
- `get_cached_time_periods()` - Get time periods with caching
- `clear_cache()` - Clear all cached data

## Error Handling

All functions handle network and parsing errors gracefully:

```python
import swimrankings
from swimrankings import NetworkError, ParseError

try:
    countries = swimrankings.fetch_countries()
except NetworkError as e:
    print(f"Network error: {e}")
except ParseError as e:
    print(f"Parsing error: {e}")
```

The utility functions (like `get_country_name`) return `None` if an error occurs or the data is not found, making them safe to use without explicit error handling.
