    """
    Create a plot of the cost against iterations for either a single cost history or
    a set of cost histories.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cost_histories : list
        The values of the cost histories.
        Must be either a list of a single cost history or a list of several cost histories,
        where each individual cost history is a list.
        For example, a single cost history can be passed
        (``cost_histories = [0.1, 0.05, 0.02]``) or multiple cost histories
        (``cost_histories = [[0.1, 0.05, 0.02], [0.23, 0.2, 0.14, 0.1, 0.04, 0.015]]``).
    labels : list[str] or None, optional
        The labels corresponding to the individual cost histories in `cost_histories`.
        If you provide this, it must be the same length as `cost_histories`.
    y_axis_log : bool, optional
        Whether the y-axis is log-scale.
        Defaults to False.
    initial_iteration : int, optional
        Where the iteration count on the x-axis starts from.
        This is useful if you want to include the initial cost—before optimization—at
        iteration 0 or if you pass cost histories that start at a later iteration.
        Defaults to 1.
    figure : matplotlib.figure.Figure or None, optional
        A matplotlib Figure in which to place the plots.
        If passed, its dimensions and axes will be overridden.

    Examples
    --------
    Compare the cost histories of two closed-loop optimizers. ::
