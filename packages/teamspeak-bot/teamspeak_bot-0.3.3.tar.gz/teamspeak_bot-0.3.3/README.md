# TeamSpeak Bot

TeamSpeak server query bot. This bot is mainly an example project using the [TSBot](https://github.com/jykob/TSBot) framework.

## ‚úÖ Features

### üîß Admin

Collection of helpful debugging commands:

- `eval <eval str>`: Evaluates given python expression.
- `exec <exec str>`: Executes given python expression. Persists any side-effects.
- `quit`: Closes the bot.
- `send <query>`: Sends a raw query to the teamspeak server and return the response data.
- `spam <#lines> <text to be spammed>` : Spams the current ctx of the message.
- `nickname <nickname>`: Changes the bot nickname. If no nickname provided, defaults to the login name.

You probably don't want anyone running these commands, so they are locked behind checks. You can configure the bot to check for specific _uids_ or server groups that have the permission to run these commands.

### üö∂ AFK Mover

Checks periodically for clients that haven't been active for given amount of time.  
If such clients are found, move them to specified _AFK_ channel.

If the bot doesn't find _AFK_ channel, it will try to create one.
You can white/blacklist channels where clients can be moved from.
If you have _Jail_ plugin enabled, You might want to add your jail channel to the blacklist.

### üì£ Announce

Announce a message to clients by poking them.  
You can announce to a specific group or to all clients.

- `announce "Hello all"`: Pokes all clients with a message "Hello all"
- `announce "Team meeting now!" Staff`: Pokes clients in "Staff" server group with "Team meeting now!"

### ‚õî Banned names

Kicks out any clients with configured nickname.  
You can configure a list of banned nicknames or provide a function that return a boolean telling the bot if a given nickname is allowed.

By default, the bot will only kick the default TeamSpeak nickname: `TeamSpeakUser`

- `coinflip`: Flips a coin, responding with heads or tails.

### üëã Greeter

### üõÇ Jail
