DILImap & ToxPredictor
======================

**DILImap** is a pioneering toxicogenomics atlas purpose-built for modeling Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI).
It features RNA-seq profiles from primary human hepatocytes exposed to 300 diverse compounds. It offers a powerful foundation for mechanistic insight and predictive modeling.

**ToxPredictor**, trained on DILImap, sets a new benchmark in DILI risk assessment. With 89% sensitivity at 100% specificity,
it outperforms traditional methods and reliably flags even the most elusive DILI-prone drugs, including withdrawn and idiosyncratic compounds.
