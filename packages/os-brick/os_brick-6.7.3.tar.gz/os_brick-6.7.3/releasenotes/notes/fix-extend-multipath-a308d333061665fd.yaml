    `Bug #2032177 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/2032177>`_:
    Handled the issue when one or more paths of a multipath device are down and
    we try to extend the device. This is addressed by adding an additional check
    to verify that all devices are up before extending the multipath device to
    avoid leaving devices with inconsistent sizes.
