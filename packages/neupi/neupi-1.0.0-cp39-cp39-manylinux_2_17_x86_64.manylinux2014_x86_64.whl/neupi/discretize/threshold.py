class ThresholdDiscretizer(BaseDiscretizer):
    """
    Discretizes a tensor of probabilities to binary assignments based on a threshold.

    This class acts as a callable function. An instance can be passed to an
    inference engine and called to perform the discretization.

    Args:
        threshold (float): The threshold value. Values >= threshold will be 1,
                           and values < threshold will be 0. Defaults to 0.5.
