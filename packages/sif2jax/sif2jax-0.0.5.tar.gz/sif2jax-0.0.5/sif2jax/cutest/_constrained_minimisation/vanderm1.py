    """VANDERM1 problem - Vandermonde matrix nonlinear equation system.

    A nonlinear equation problem, subject to monotonicity constraints.
    The Jacobian is a dense Vandermonde matrix.

    Problems VANDERM1, VANDERM2, VANDERM3 and VANDERM4 differ by the rhs
    of the equation. They are increasingly degenerate.

    The problem is non-convex.
