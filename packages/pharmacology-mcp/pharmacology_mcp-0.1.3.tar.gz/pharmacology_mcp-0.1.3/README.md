MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY database, providing access to pharmacological data including targets, ligands, and interactions.

This server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, providing a standardized interface for accessing pharmacological data. MCP enables AI assistants and agents to access specialized pharmacological knowledge through structured interfaces to authoritative data sources.

The Guide to PHARMACOLOGY is an expert-curated database of drug targets and their ligands, providing comprehensive information about:

- **Targets**: Pharmacological targets (receptors, enzymes, ion channels, etc.)
- **Ligands**: Chemical compounds and drugs
- **Interactions**: Target-ligand interactions with affinity data
- **Diseases**: Disease associations
- **Families**: Target family classifications

If you want to understand more about what the Model Context Protocol is and how to use it more efficiently, you can take the [DeepLearning AI Course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic/) or search for MCP videos on YouTube.

## About MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP is a protocol that bridges the gap between AI systems and specialized domain knowledge. It enables:

- **Structured Access**: Direct connection to authoritative pharmacological data sources
- **Natural Language Queries**: Simplified interaction with specialized databases
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing and validation through FastMCP
- **AI Integration**: Seamless integration with AI assistants and agents

## Quick Start

### Installing uv

```bash
# Download and install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Verify installation
uv --version
uvx --version
```

uvx is a very nice tool that can run a python package installing it if needed.

### Running with uvx

You can run the pharmacology-mcp server directly using uvx without cloning the repository:

```bash
# Run the server in streamed http mode (default)
uvx pharmacology-mcp
```

<details>
<summary>Other uvx modes (STDIO, HTTP, SSE)</summary>

#### STDIO Mode (for MCP clients that require stdio, can be useful when you want to save files)

```bash
# Or explicitly specify stdio mode
uvx pharmacology-mcp stdio
```

#### HTTP Mode (Web Server)
```bash
# Run the server in streamable HTTP mode on default (3001) port
uvx pharmacology-mcp server

# Run on a specific port
uvx pharmacology-mcp server --port 8000
```

#### SSE Mode (Server-Sent Events)
```bash
# Run the server in SSE mode
uvx pharmacology-mcp sse
```

</details>

In cases when there are problems with uvx often they can be caused by cleaning uv cache:
```
uv cache clean
```

The HTTP mode will start a web server that you can access at `http://localhost:3001/mcp` (with documentation at `http://localhost:3001/docs`). The STDIO mode is designed for MCP clients that communicate via standard input/output, while SSE mode uses Server-Sent Events for real-time communication.

### API Endpoints

The server provides REST API endpoints for:

- **Targets**: Pharmacological targets (receptors, enzymes, ion channels, etc.)
- **Ligands**: Chemical compounds and drugs
- **Interactions**: Target-ligand interactions with affinity data
- **Diseases**: Disease associations
- **Families**: Target family classifications

### Example API Usage

```python
import httpx

# Search for GPCR targets
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/targets",
        json={"type": "GPCR", "immuno": True}
    )
    targets = response.json()

# Get specific target information
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.get("http://localhost:8000/targets/1")
    target = response.json()

# Search for approved drugs
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/ligands",
        json={"approved": True, "type": "Synthetic organic"}
    )
    ligands = response.json()
```

### Usage Example

![Pharmacology MCP Usage Example](images/pharma_example.jpg)

### Local File Tools

The server also provides MCP tools for saving search results to files:

- `search_targets_to_file`: Search targets and save results
- `search_ligands_to_file`: Search ligands and save results
- `get_target_interactions_to_file`: Get target interactions and save
- `get_ligand_interactions_to_file`: Get ligand interactions and save

## Configuring your AI Client (Anthropic Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

We provide preconfigured JSON files for different use cases:

- **For STDIO mode (recommended):** Use `mcp-config-stdio.json`
- **For HTTP mode:** Use `mcp-config.json` 
- **For local development:** Use `mcp-config-stdio-debug.json`

### Inspecting Pharmacology MCP server

<details>
<summary>Using MCP Inspector to explore server capabilities</summary>

If you want to inspect the methods provided by the MCP server, use npx (you may need to install nodejs and npm):

For STDIO mode with uvx:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --config mcp-config-stdio.json --server pharmacology-mcp
```

For HTTP mode (ensure server is running first):
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --config mcp-config.json --server pharmacology-mcp
```

For local development:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --config mcp-config-stdio-debug.json --server pharmacology-mcp
```

You can also run the inspector manually and configure it through the interface:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

After that you can explore the tools and resources with MCP Inspector at http://127.0.0.1:6274

### Integration with AI Systems

Simply point your AI client (like Cursor, Windsurf, ClaudeDesktop, VS Code with Copilot, or [others](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-clients)) to use the appropriate configuration file from the repository.

## Repository setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/antonkulaga/pharmacology-mcp.git
cd pharmacology-mcp
uv sync
```

### Running the MCP Server

If you already cloned the repo you can run the server with uv:

```bash
# Start the MCP server locally (HTTP mode)
uv run server

# Or start in STDIO mode  
uv run stdio

# Or start in SSE mode
uv run sse
```

## Testing & Verification

Run tests for the MCP server:
```bash
uv run pytest -vvv -s
```

You can use MCP inspector with locally built MCP server same way as with uvx.

### Troubleshooting

#### Timeout Issues
If you encounter timeout errors when using tools with `approved=True` parameter (which can be slow due to large datasets), the server is configured with 30-second timeouts. You can:

1. **Use more specific filters** to reduce response size
2. **Check your internet connection** for stability  
3. **Run tests individually** if the full test suite times out:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_judged_simple.py::TestPharmacologyMCPJudged::test_search_dopamine_targets_judged -v
   ```

#### Cache Issues with uvx
If you encounter problems with uvx, try cleaning the uv cache:
```bash
uv cache clean
```

*Note: Using the MCP Inspector is optional. Most MCP clients (like Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) will automatically display the available tools from this server once configured. However, the Inspector can be useful for detailed testing and exploration.*

*If you choose to use the Inspector via `npx`, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) is recommended for managing Node.js versions.*
