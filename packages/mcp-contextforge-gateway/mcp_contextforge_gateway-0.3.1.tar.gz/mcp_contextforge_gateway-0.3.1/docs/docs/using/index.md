# Using MCP Gateway

This section focuses on how to use MCP Gateway effectively as a developer, integrator, or end user.

## ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» Typical Use Cases

- You want to expose tools, prompts, or resources via MCP.
- You want to use `mcpgateway-wrapper` to connect to any MCP Gateway service using `stdio`, while still supporting authentication to the gateway.
- You're building a client or agent framework that speaks the MCP protocol.
- You want to consume Gateway APIs from an LLM agent, browser app, or CLI tool.

## ðŸ”‘ Authentication Reminder

All Gateway usage requires authentication unless `AUTH_REQUIRED=false`. Refer to:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:4444/tools
```

Or use Basic Auth for the Admin UI and `/admin` routes.
