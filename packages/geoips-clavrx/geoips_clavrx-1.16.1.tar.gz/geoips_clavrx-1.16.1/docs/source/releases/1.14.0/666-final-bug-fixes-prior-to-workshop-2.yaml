bug fix:
- description: |
    Add latest.rst to .gitignore because we will now auto-generate it within
    the doc build, so we do not want to update it within the repo.

    Additionally, remove empty latest.rst, and latest section from index.rst,
    since these will be auto-generated/updated from build_docs.sh
  files:
    modified:
    - '.gitignore'
    - 'docs/source/releases/index.rst'
    deleted:
    - 'docs/source/releases/latest.rst'
