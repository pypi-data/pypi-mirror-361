@dataclass()
class MesoscopeHardwareState(YamlConfig):
    """Stores configuration parameters (states) of the Mesoscope-VR system hardware modules used during training or
    experiment runtime.

    This information is used to read and decode the data saved to the .npz log files during runtime as part of data
    processing.

    Notes:
        This class stores 'static' Mesoscope-VR system configuration that does not change during experiment or training
        session runtime. This is in contrast to MesoscopeExperimentState class, which reflects the 'dynamic' state of
        the Mesoscope-VR system.

        This class partially overlaps with the MesoscopeSystemConfiguration class, which is also stored in the
        raw_data folder of each session. The primary reason to keep both classes is to ensure that the math (rounding)
        used during runtime matches the math (rounding) used during data processing. MesoscopeSystemConfiguration does
        not do any rounding or otherwise attempt to be repeatable, which is in contrast to hardware module that read
        those parameters. Reading values from this class guarantees the read value exactly matches the value used
        during runtime.

    Notes:
        All fields in this dataclass initialize to None. During log processing, any log associated with a hardware
        module that provides the data stored in a field will be processed, unless that field is None. Therefore, setting
        any field in this dataclass to None also functions as a flag for whether to parse the log associated with the
        module that provides this field's information.

        This class is automatically configured by _MesoscopeExperiment and _BehaviorTraining classes from sl-experiment
        library to facilitate log parsing.

    Zaber motor positions across consecutive runtimes for the same project and animal combination.

        All positions are saved using native motor units. All class fields initialize to default placeholders that are
        likely NOT safe to apply to the VR system. Do not apply the positions loaded from the file unless you are
        certain they are safe to use.

        Exercise caution when working with Zaber motors. The motors are powerful enough to damage the surrounding
        equipment and manipulated objects. Do not modify the data stored inside the .yaml file unless you know what you
        are doing.
