Motivation & Aim
================

Experimental psychologists and linguistics researchers require unbiased, high-entropy stimulus lists for experiments involving human language production. The human brain is highly sensitive to patterns and adapts quickly, which can introduce bias and affect response times in experimental results. PRLGEN maximizes entropy in stimulus presentation, resetting participant expectations and minimizing statistical bias by ensuring that items of the same group or category do not appear consecutively beyond a controlled threshold.
