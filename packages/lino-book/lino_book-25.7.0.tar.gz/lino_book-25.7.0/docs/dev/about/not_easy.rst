Lino is a big beast
===================

Lino is a big beast to tackle because it has (compared to plain Django or
similar frameworks) rather high-level concepts: tables, forms, slave tables,
menus, actions, virtual fields...

For an :term:`application developer` this means that it may take a day or two before
you fall in love with Lino.  Lino requires you to :doc:`think in
Python <think_python>`.  But we hope that your love will last longer.
