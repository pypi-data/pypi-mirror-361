        The returned relation has a heading the same as relationValue2 and a body consisting of those tuples in
        relationValue2 that would have been included in the natural join with relationValue1.
        As with join, if the -using argument are missing, the join is computed across the attributes in
        relationValue1 and relationValue2 that are named the same. Otherwise the attrList argument is treated
        the same as for the join subcommand.

        Also like the join subcommand, additional relationValue arguments may be given and the result is computed
        in left to right order.

        This implies that the type of the result is always the type of the right most relationValue.
        N.B. the sense of this command is inverted from previous versions of this library.

        (NOTE: I only just NOW realized that the TclRAL join command provides an option to specify multiple renames
        as part of a join, because, of course it does! Argghh. So there may not be any need to perform multiple renames
        at once, but hey, there's no harm in providing potentially superfluous functionality as it does at least
        handle the single rename case. - LS)

        Given an input relation, rename one or more attributes from old to new names. This is useful when you want
        to join two relvars on attributes with differing names.

        In SM xUML, it is common for an attribute with one name to reference another attribute of the same
        type but a different name, Employee_ID -> Manager, for exmaple.

        We often need to rename multiple attributes before performing a join, so the single attribute rename
        operation provided by TclRAL is executed once for each element of the names dictionary.

        TclRAL rename syntax:
            relation rename <relationValue> ?oldname newname ...?

        Multiple rename example in TclRAL:
            relation rename ${Attribute_Reference} To_attribute Name
            relation rename ${^relation} To_class Class

        (^relation) is the name of PyRAL's intermediate result session variable, so we are feeding
        the result of the first rename into the next.

        Generated from the PyRAL input:

        used as the per relation. The arguments and results are otherwise the same as for the summarize command.

            relation rank relationValue ?-ascending | -descending? rankAttr newAttr

        The rank subcommand returns a new relation whose heading is the same as relationValue
        extending by an attribute named newAttr. The type of newAttr will be int and its value
        will be set to the number of tuples in relationValue where the value of rankAttr is
        less than or equal to (?-descending?) or greater than or equal to (?-ascending?) that of
        the given tuple. The default ranking is -ascending.

        The type of rankAttr must be int, double, or string.

        The rank command is useful when it is desirable to limit the number of tuples in the result.

        PyRAL example:

            result = Relation.rank(db=ev, relation="shafts_rv", sort_attr_name="Speed", order=Order.DESCENDING)

        TclRAL documentation:

            relation tag relationValue attrName ?-ascending | -descending sort-attr-list? ?-within attr-list?

        The tag subcommand creates a new relation which has the same heading as relationValue extended by a
        new attribute named attrName. The type of attrName will be int and will have the values between 0 and the
        cardinality of relationValue minus one. The tuples in relationValue will be extended in either ascending or
        descending order of the sort-attr-list.

        If no sort-attr-list argument is given, then the tagging order is arbitrary.

        If the ?-within? argument is given then the values of attrName attribute will be unique within the subset
        of tuples which match the values of attr-list. The tag command is useful when a full ordering needs to be
        placed on a relation. For example, tagging a relation will allow projecting both the tag and another
        attribute without losing any values.

        We do this by ranking all aircraft tuples according to altitude in descending order.

        Here we select zero or more tuples that match the supplied criteria.

        In relational theory this is known as a restriction operation.

        TclRAL syntax:
            relation restrictwith <relationValue> <expression>

        The most common usage scenario is to select on a single identifier attribute value.

            R = f"ID:S1"
            result = Relation.restrict(db=ev, relation="shafts_rv", restriction=R, svar_name="restriction")

            +======+=========+==============+
            | S1   |      31 | True         |
            +------+---------+--------------+

            This yields the TclRAL statement

            relation restrictwith ${shafts_rv} {[string match {S1} $ID]}

            So we have the command, a relation variable, and the string match.
            The string match arguments are the value to match and the name of the attribute as a tcl variable

        If there is any whitespace in the value, use <> brackets to enclose it. For example:

            R = f"Level_name:<3rd Floor>"

        Note that the attribute names must be specified in snake case. Relation names can have spaces, but are
        automatically converted to snake case in the generated TclRAL. It's a bit trickier to do this with all the
        attribute names since they are embedded in the restriction expression, so we put that burden on
        the user.

        Note that the : symbol is shorthand for matching and only works with strings. The == operator can
        only be used to match numeric values.

        You can match multiple values using the ', ' to AND them together. Here is the supplied PyRAL expression
        and generated TclRAL expression:

            PyRAL: R = f"ID:<{i}>, In_service:<{True}>"
            TclRAL: {[string match {S1} $ID] && [string match {True} $In_service]}

        Here we use i to specify the "S1" ID value using the python formatted string {} brackets.
        The brackets around True are necessary to ensure a boolean value is inserted and not the "True" string.
        (though the string value would work as well since Tcl represents a boolean value as a truthy string)

        Numeric comparisons can be supplied using the usual operators with s set to the integer 14:

            PyRAL: R = f"Speed > {s}"
            TclRAL: {[expr {$Speed > 14}]}

        In a numeric comparison you do not need to surround the numeric value with <> brackets.

        Finally, you can express more complex logic using nested parentheses and the logic operators
        AND, OR, NOT as follows:

            PyRAL: R = f"ID:<{v}> OR (In_service:<{True}> AND Speed > {s})"
            TclRAL: {[string match {S1} $ID] || ([string match {True} $In_service] && [expr {$Speed > 31}])}

        :param relation: Name of a relation variable where the operation is applied
        :param restriction: A string in Scrall notation that specifies the restriction criteria
        :param svar_name: An optional session variable that holds the result
