## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any issues you find.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at:
**[security@gimp-mcp.com](mailto:security@gimp-mcp.com)**

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand and resolve the issue:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve by exploiting this vulnerability
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Operating system, Python version, GIMP version, and any other relevant details
- **Proof of Concept**: Code, screenshots, or other evidence demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue, please include them

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate the issue and determine its severity
3. **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing with you
4. **Disclosure**: We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after a fix is available

### Expected Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days for critical issues, 90 days for others

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of GIMP MCP Server
2. **Secure Environment**: Run the server in a secure, isolated environment
3. **Network Security**: Use appropriate firewall rules and network segmentation
4. **Access Control**: Limit access to the MCP server to authorized clients only
5. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review server logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
3. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date
4. **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed for security implications
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in your development process

## Known Security Considerations

### GIMP Integration

- **File System Access**: The server has access to the file system through GIMP operations
- **Process Execution**: GIMP operations may execute system processes
- **Memory Usage**: Large images can consume significant memory resources

### Network Security

- **Authentication**: Currently, the server does not implement authentication
- **Transport Security**: Communications are not encrypted by default
- **DoS Prevention**: No built-in protection against denial-of-service attacks

### Recommended Mitigations

1. **Firewall Rules**: Restrict network access to the server
2. **User Isolation**: Run the server with minimal privileges
3. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory and CPU limits
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for security events
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep GIMP and system dependencies updated

## Vulnerability Classification

We use the following severity levels for vulnerabilities:

### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data exfiltration

### High
- Denial of service
- Information disclosure
- Authentication bypass

### Medium
- Local privilege escalation
- Cross-site scripting (if applicable)
- Input validation issues

### Low
- Information leakage
- Minor security misconfigurations
- Non-exploitable vulnerabilities

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as follows:

- **Critical**: Emergency patch within 24-48 hours
- **High**: Patch within 7 days
- **Medium**: Patch within 30 days
- **Low**: Patch in next regular release

## Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: For all severity levels
2. **Release Notes**: Summary in release notes
3. **Documentation**: Updated security documentation
4. **Notifications**: Email notifications to registered users

## Bug Bounty Program

We are considering establishing a bug bounty program for security researchers. Stay tuned for updates.

## Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly audit our dependencies for security vulnerabilities using:

- **GitHub Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Safety**: Python package vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk**: Continuous security monitoring

## Compliance

This security policy is designed to be compatible with:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **OWASP Top 10**
- **ISO 27001 best practices**
