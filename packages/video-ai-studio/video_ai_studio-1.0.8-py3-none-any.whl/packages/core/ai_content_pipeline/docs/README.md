### `parallel_executor_poc.py`
**Purpose**: Proof-of-concept demonstration of parallel vs sequential execution

**What it does**:
- Demonstrates basic parallel execution concepts
- Compares performance between parallel and sequential TTS generation
- Shows thread-based concurrent execution

**Usage**:
```bash
cd ai_content_pipeline
python examples/parallel_executor_poc.py
```

**Note**: This is an educational example. For production use, use the built-in parallel pipeline features via YAML configuration.

## üéØ When to use these examples

- **Learning**: Understand how parallel execution works under the hood
- **Benchmarking**: Compare performance characteristics
- **Development**: Reference implementations for new features
- **Debugging**: Isolated test cases for specific functionality
