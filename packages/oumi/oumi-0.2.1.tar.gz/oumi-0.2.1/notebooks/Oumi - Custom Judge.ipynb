For this, we define the `BananaJudgement` class, which must inherit from `BaseJudgeOutput`.

Similarly to `BananaMessage`, we can define a template in XML format (or whatever format makes sense for our use case) to easily extract the `label` from the judge's response (`raw_judgement`). But, for simplicity, we set no template (no special characters or words to wrap the `raw_judgement`), which means that we teach the judge to respond directly with the label. This is consistent with our `judge_SI` (above), where we request that the model only respond with `True` or `False`.\n",
