#14 : inheriting verbose_name from abstract Model
=================================================

I'd like to have the following class definitions:

1. In :mod:`lino_xl.lib.contacts.models`::

    from django.db import models
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
      
    class Company(models.Model):
        class Meta:
            app_name = 'contacts'
            abstract=True
            verbose_name_plural = _('Companies')
            verbose_name = _('Company')
      
      
2. In :mod:`lino.projects.dsbe.models` (:mod:`lino.modlib.igen.models`) I'd like to not 
   worry about `verbose_name`, `verbose_name_plural` and `abstract`::

    from lino_xl.lib.contacts import models as contacts
    
    class Company(contacts.Company):
        pass


And this should work if I understood 
`the docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/models/#meta-inheritance>`_ 
correctly.

It seems that Django also clears the `verbose_name_plural` meta option of abstract models
