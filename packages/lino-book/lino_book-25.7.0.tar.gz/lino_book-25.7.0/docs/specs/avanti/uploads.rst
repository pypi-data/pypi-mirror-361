Uploads with expiration date management
=======================================

.. currentmodule:: lino_xl.lib.uploads

The :mod:`lino_xl.lib.uploads` plugin extends :mod:`lino.modlib.uploads` by
adding "expiration date management" for uploads.  This is used by social agents
("coaches") to manage certain documents about their "clients". For example the
coach might want to get a reminder when the driving license of one of their
clients is about to expire.

This plugin requires the :mod:`lino_xl.lib.clients` plugin.

.. include:: /../docs/shared/include/tested.rst

>>> from lino_book.projects.avanti1.startup import *

Although this plugin requires the :mod:`lino_xl.lib.clients` plugin, it does not
declare this dependency because making it automatic would
cause changes in the menu item ordering in :ref:`welfare`.

The plugin has two custom settings, which are the default values for the
:class:`MyExpiringUploads` table:

>>> dd.plugins.uploads.expiring_start
-30
>>> dd.plugins.uploads.expiring_end
365

The demo_coach is the user who uploaded all demo uploads.

>>> dd.plugins.clients.demo_coach
'nathalie'

We have two social workers Nathalie and Nelly.

Note that uploads #4 and #3 were not uploaded by the client's primary coach.

>>> obj = rt.models.uploads.Upload.objects.get(pk=3)
>>> prj = rt.models.avanti.Client.objects.get(pk=15)
>>> rec = rt.login("nathalie").spawn(uploads.UploadsByProject, master_instance=prj).elem2rec_detailed(obj)
>>> print(rec['disable_delete'])
None

Nelly (another social worker) and Sandra (secretary) can also modify the upload

>>> rec = rt.login("nelly").spawn(uploads.UploadsByProject, master_instance=prj).elem2rec_detailed(obj)
>>> print(rec['disable_delete'])
None
>>> rec = rt.login("sandra").spawn(uploads.UploadsByProject, master_instance=prj).elem2rec_detailed(obj)
>>> print(rec['disable_delete'])
None

But Laura (a teacher) cannot edit them:

>>> rec = rt.login("laura").spawn(uploads.UploadsByProject, master_instance=prj).elem2rec_detailed(obj)
>>> print(rec['disable_delete'])
You have no permission to delete this row.

Note about security. You might wonder why Sandra is able to see data that she
isn't allow to see:

>>> print(rec['data']['project'])
ABBAS Aábid (16/nelly)

This is *not* a security issue because we are at the command line interface
where access rights are not verified.  If Sandra would do a manual AJAX call,
she would not be able to see data that she isn't allow to see. Here is the proof:

>>> test_client.force_login(rt.login("laura").user)
>>> url = "/api/avanti/Clients?fmt=json&&limit=23&start=0"
>>> test_client.get(url)  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Forbidden (Permission denied): /api/avanti/Clients
Traceback (most recent call last):

Extended uploads
================

.. class:: Upload

    Extends :class:`lino.modlib.uploads.Upload` by adding some fields.

    .. attribute:: start_date

    .. attribute:: end_date

      Date until which the original document is valid.

    .. attribute:: needed

      Whether the responsible user should be reminded when validity of this
      upload reaches its end.



My expiring upload files
========================

When you want Lino to remind you when some important document (e.g. a driving
licence) is about to expire, then you should store the document's expiry date in
the :attr:`Upload.end_date` field and check the :attr:`Upload.needed` field.

.. class:: MyExpiringUploads

    Shows the upload files that are marked as :attr:`Upload.needed` and whose
    :attr:`Upload.end_date` is within a given period.
