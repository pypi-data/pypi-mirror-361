    Inverse Generation of WGRP Samples

    Quantile function for the WGRP (Weibull-based Generalized Renewal Process)
    with scale parameter `a`, shape parameter `b`, rejuvenation parameter `q`,
    vector of mixed Kijima (MK) coefficients `propagations`, vector of desired
    probabilities `reliabilities`, and starting virtual age `previous_virtual_age`.
    MK coefficients allow one to distinguish the impact of preventive and corrective
    interventions.

    Parameters:
        n (int):
            The number of interventions taken into account. Due to the usual number of parameters
            of the model (`a`, `b`, `q`, `MK_{PM}`, and `MK_{CM}`), one must work with `n > 6`.
        a (float):
            The scale parameter. Similarly to the Weibull distribution, one must work with `a > 0`.
        b (float):
            The shape parameter. Similarly to the Weibull distribution, one must work with `b > 0`.
            This parameter reflects the stage faced by the system under study, whether stable, improving
            or deteriorating. If `b = 1`, one has an exponential distribution underlying the process.
            It implies in a stable system, i.e. without memory (in which the intervention rate is constant
            through the time). In turn, if `b < 1`, one usually has an improving system (in which the
            intervention rate decreases as time evolves). Finally, if `b > 1`, one usually has a
            deteriorating system (in which the intervention rate increases as time evolves). However,
            the meaning of `b` might change depending on the value of `q`.
        q (float):
            The rejuvenation parameter. It allows one to study the quality of the intervention system.
            If `q = 0`, one has the Weibull-based Renewal Process - RP (in which each intervention usually
            brings the system to an 'as good as new' - AGAN condition). If `q = 1`, one has the
            Weibull-based Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process - NHPP (in which each intervention usually
            brings the system to an 'as bad as old' - ABAO condition). On the other hand, if `b > 1`, then
            `0 < q < 1` might reflect that each intervention usually brings the system to an intermediate
            condition, between AGAN and ABAO. Further, either `b < 1` and `q > 1` or `b > 1` and `q < 0`
            might reflect the situations in which each intervention usually brings the system to a 'better
            than in its beginning' condition.
        propagations (list of float):
            A numeric vector of size `n`. Let `y_i` be the type of the i-th intervention (e.g. a preventive
            maintenance - PM or a corrective maintenance - CM). Further, let `c(y_i)` be the i-th element
            of `propagations`, related to the intervention type `y_i`. Thus, `c(y_i)` reflects the weight
            between Kijima Type I and Kijima Type II virtual age models intrinsic to `y_i`. Then,
            `0 <= c(y_i) <= 1` in such a way that `c(y_i) = 1` leads to Kijima Type I and `c(y_i) = 0`
            leads to Kijima Type II.
        reliabilities  (list of float) :
            A numeric vector of size `n`. The probabilities under which the WGRP quantiles must be computed.
            If `reliabilities` is not set, then a random sequence is internally created.
        previous_virtual_age (float):
            The starting value of the virtual age underlying the system, reflecting its initial condition,
            according to the virtual age concept. If `previous_virtual_age` is not set, then it is assumed
            that the system is new, i.e., `previous_virtual_age = 0`.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing:
        - 'reliabilities': The probabilities under which the WGRP quantiles have been computed.
        - 'times': The times between interventions related to `reliabilities`.
        - 'virtualAges': The virtual ages related to `times`.

    Examples:
        >>> n = 10
        >>> a = 10
        >>> b = 2
        >>> q = 0.5
        >>> event_types = np.random.choice(["CM", "PM"], size=n, replace=True)
        >>> propagations = np.where(event_types == "CM", 0.8, 0.3)
        >>> reliabilities = np.full(n, 0.5)
        >>> previousVirtualAge = 10
        >>> result = qwgrp(n, a, b, q, propagations, reliabilities, previousVirtualAge)
        >>> len(result['reliabilities']) == n
        True
        >>> len(result['times']) == n
        True
        >>> len(result['virtualAges']) == n
