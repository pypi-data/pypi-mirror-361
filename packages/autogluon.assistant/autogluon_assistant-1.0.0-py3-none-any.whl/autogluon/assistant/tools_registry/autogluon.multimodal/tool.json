  "version": "1.2.0",
  "description": "AutoGluon Multimodal is an open-source AutoML framework that simplifies the training of models across multiple data types including text, images, and tabular data, automating tasks from preprocessing to model ensembling with minimal code required.",
  "features": [
    "Support multimodal classification or regression, document classification, semantic segmentation",
    "Does not work the best with pure tabular data (categorical and numerical).",
    "Does not support any generation tasks like image-to-image or sequence-to-sequence."
  ],
  "requirements": [],
  "prompt_template": [
    "tuning_data: only use validation if there is a validation dataset.",
    "The usage of document prediction is different from image prediction.",
    "Check data path carefully when encounter ValueError: No model is available for this dataset.",
    "No need to specify model.names, and do not increase default per gpu batch size to avoid OOM errors.",
    "For semantic segmentation, use single GPU by setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0",
    "For semantic segmentation, the predicted mask should be saved as greyscale JPG image in \\\"predicted_mask\\\" folder under output folder and save its absolute path in label column."
