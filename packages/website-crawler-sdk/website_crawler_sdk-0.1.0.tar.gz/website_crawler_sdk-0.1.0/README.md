# website_crawler_sdk

A Python SDK for interacting with [WebsiteCrawler.org](https://www.websitecrawler.org), designed to simplify crawling tasks via API. Submit URLs, monitor crawling status, and retrieve structured data with ease.

To use the API, get your API key from [WebsiteCrawler.org](https://www.websitecrawler.org)

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Trigger crawl jobs remotely
- Monitor crawling status in real time
- Access current URLs being crawled
- Fetch crawl output as raw JSON
- Respect API wait times dynamically

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can install it locally for development:

```bash
pip install website_crawler_sdk
```

##Demo

```
import time
from website_crawler_sdk import WebsiteCrawlerConfig, WebsiteCrawlerClient

# Replace with your actual API key, target URL, and limit
YOUR_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY" #Your API key goes here
URL = "URL" #Enter a non redirecting URL/domain with https or http
LIMIT = LIMIT #Change limit 

def main():
    cfg = WebsiteCrawlerConfig(YOUR_API_KEY)
    client = WebsiteCrawlerClient(cfg)

    # Submit URL to WebsiteCrawler.org for crawling
    client.submit_url_to_website_crawler(URL, LIMIT) #Submit the URL and Limit to websitecrawler via API

    while True:
        task_status = client.get_task_status() #Start retrieving data if the task_status is true
        print(f"{task_status} << task status")
        time.sleep(2)  #Wait for 2 seconds

        if task_status:
            status = client.get_crawl_status() #get_crawl_status() method gets the crawl status
            currenturl = client.get_current_url() #get_current_url() method gets the current URL
            data = client.get_crawl_data() # get_crawl_data() method gets the structured data once crawling has completed

            print("Crawl status::")
            if status:
                print(status)

            if status == "Crawling": #Crawling is one of the status
                print(f"Current URL:: {currenturl}")

            if status == "Completed!":  #Completed! (with exclamation) is one of the status
                print("Task has been completed... closing the loop")
                if data:
                    print(f"JSON Data:: {data}")
                    time.sleep(20)  # Give extra time for large JSON response
                    break

    print("Job over")
