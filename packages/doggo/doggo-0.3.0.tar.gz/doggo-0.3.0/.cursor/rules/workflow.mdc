## Workflow

These are the steps to follow when making changes to the codebase:

- Before making any changes, check the file structure and gather any change that the developer might have made.
- Always run tests after making the changes.
- Run tests using `uv run pytest -v`
- Ask the developer if test must be implemented in a separate phase.
