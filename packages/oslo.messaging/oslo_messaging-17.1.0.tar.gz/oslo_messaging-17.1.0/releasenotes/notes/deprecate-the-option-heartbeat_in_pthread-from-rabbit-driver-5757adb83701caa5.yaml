deprecations:
  - |
    The ``heartbeat_in_pthread`` option from the rabbitmq driver has been
    deprecated and it is recommended not to use the feature anymore.
    The option is strongly related to Eventlet but Eventlet will be removed
    from OpenStack services in a future release. In addition, this feature has
    never worked with services using eventlet for core service framework.
