    At release time, we became aware that recent changes to the
    nvmeof connector were tested only in configurations where the
    NVMe storage backend supports namespace AER.  One issue arising
    from this is being tracked by `Bug #1961102
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1961102>`_.
